1. The breaching direction is the direction of the "breaching line". 2. The search area for the two covering positions (close covering and distant covering) is a sector segment, between the "minimum range for searching for covering positions" and the "maximum range for searching for covering positions". The azimuth of the sector's center is the reciprocal azimuth of the "breaching direction". 3. The close covering position is searched for with the aim of controlling the "close control area at the obstacle" - a circular area centered on the breaching point. 4. The distant covering position is searched for with the aim of controlling the "enemy position ellipse", within the range limitation of the distant covering force's weapon system. - The "enemy position ellipse" is an ellipse facing the specified breaching point and centered on the "enemy position" point. - The "enemy position" is in the "distant control area at the obstacle": a sector segment between the "minimum range for distant control at the obstacle" and the "maximum range for distant control at the obstacle". The azimuth of the sector's center is the azimuth of the "breaching direction". - The "enemy position" is at the location of the closest combat enemy detection to the breaching point out of all enemy detections in the "distant control area at the obstacle". If there is no such enemy detection - an optimal "assumed enemy position" is searched for to control the "close control area at the obstacle". If one is not found - an "assumed enemy position" is arbitrarily assumed at the center of the "distant control area at the obstacle". - If no accessible distant covering position is found within the search area - the distant covering force is positioned at the close covering position. 5. The bridgehead position is searched for - in a corridor around a segment of the continuation of the route of advance, which ends at a "maximum offset for the end of the bridgehead search corridor" at most from the breaching point (along the route) and begins at a "start offset of the bridgehead search corridor" from it. If the continuation of the route of advance is too short - it is artificially extended based on the smoothed azimuth at the end of the route, in order to ensure that the length of the search corridor is at least the "minimum length for a bridgehead search corridor". - in relation to the controlled area ellipse based on the "default for a controlled area from a position" relative to the breaching point and the breaching direction.
