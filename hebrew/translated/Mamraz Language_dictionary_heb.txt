Change of name
339
Changing the name of the receiving unit. The name is limited to a maximum of 8 characters.
340
Change of a suffix to a name
341
Changing the suffix to the name of the receiving unit.
342
Suffix to a name
343
Set a simulation frequency
344
Setting the simulation frequency of a weapons platform group.
A weapons platform group operating at a high frequency is updated at relatively short time intervals (partial time steps) on an ongoing basis, according to the flow of time on the real clock.
A weapons platform group operating at a regular (not high) frequency is updated at relatively long time intervals (time steps), during the calculation of a time step only.

Note: The current simulation frequency of a weapons platform group (duration of a partial time step/time step) is returned by the atomic function UnitSimulationCycleLength.

Activate a conversation generation rule
347
Activating the specified conversation generation rule.
348
Rule (class name)
349
The class name of the rule to be activated for the unit.
350
Preferred speakers
351
A collection of weapons platform groups from which speakers should be chosen with first priority.
352
Set the activity status of networks
353
Setting the activity status of a collection of networks from among all the unit's networks (networks for which the unit is their "owner") to the specified activity status. The collection includes every network Ni of the unit that meets the criteria defined by the filtering parameters (all are optional):
- If a network type is specified - the type of Ni belongs to the specified network type.
- If an inclusive tag is specified (hereinafter I) - the collection of tags (TAGS) that characterizes the type of Ni includes at least one tag of a type belonging to I.
- If an exclusive tag is specified (hereinafter E) - the collection of tags that characterizes the type of Ni does not include any tag of a type belonging to E.
Omitting a filtering parameter means that the corresponding criterion is not taken into account. In particular, if no filtering parameter is specified - the collection of affected networks includes all the unit's networks.

Activate a conversation generation rule in the past
359
Activating the specified conversation generation rule in the past, for the purpose of generating "historical" past conversations.
360
Activation time
361
The time in the past at which the rule is to be activated.
362
Self speaker location
363
The location attributed to the weapons platform group on which the command was activated ("the pivot unit") in any conversation activated by the rule in which it appears as a speaker. If no value is specified - the current location is valid.
364
Other speaker location
365
The location attributed to any other weapons platform group other than "the pivot unit" in any conversation activated by the rule. If no value is specified - the current location is valid.
366
Distribution of past conversations
367
- Collecting all the past conversations stored in all the weapons platform groups belonging to the executing unit and deleting them from the collection.
- Scheduling all the collected past conversations.
- Distributing the scheduled past conversations through the interface.
368
Deleting past conversations
369
Deleting all the past conversations stored in the executing weapons platform group.
370
Set a main activity
371

372
Main activity
373
Set a direction
374
Setting the direction to which the unit's vehicles/soldiers are facing.
The direction of the unit affects the activity sign - if it is directional.
375

376
Activation/deactivation of the various countermeasures available in the unit: passive means - camouflage and smoke screen, and active means - radar jammer and GPS jammer.
377
Camouflage
378
The new state of camouflage in the executing unit.
An empty value means that the state of camouflage in the unit will remain unchanged.
379
Smoke screen
380
The new state of the smoke screen in the executing unit.
An empty value means that the state of the smoke screen in the unit will remain unchanged.
381
GPS jammer
382
The new state of the GPS jammer in the executing unit.
An empty value means that the state of the GPS jammer in the unit will remain unchanged.
383
Radar jammer
384
The new state of the radar jammer in the executing unit.
An empty value means that the state of the radar jammer in the unit will remain unchanged.
385
Set an alert status
386
Setting the alert status of the unit.
Note: The initial value of the alert status is empty (undefined). A non-empty alert status value is displayed in the user interface (unit data panel).
