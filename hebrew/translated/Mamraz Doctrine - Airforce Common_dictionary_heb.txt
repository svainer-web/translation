110
Whether the specified formation has already performed its first takeoff. A 'yes' value is returned if the "last takeoff time" stored in the formation's memory is not empty.
111
The serial number of the formation's leader. In an original formation, the leader's number is always 1. In the case of a formation split, the leader's number in the new formation (containing the departing aircraft) is necessarily greater than 1.

An empty value for "leader number" is typical for an original formation and is therefore equivalent to the value 1.
113
Formation is on approach for landing
114
Whether the specified formation is in the process of approaching for landing. A 'yes' value is returned if the formation is airborne and is flying along a path with "landing on arrival" and has already entered the base's control zone (in practice: the end point of the current flight path, which is not necessarily at the base's location).

Applicable operation ID
119
The applicable operation ID for the specified formation. If the formation has a defined executed mission order - this is the operation containing the mission order, otherwise it is the "original operation ID" value stored in the formation's memory. Note: the "original operation ID" value is stored in the memory of a formation created as part of a formation split, so as not to lose its link to the operation of the mission order executed by the original formation.
120
Formation has an anchor time defined
121
Whether an anchor time is defined in the mission instructions of the specified formation.
122
Formation is allowed to fly at full power
123
Whether the formation is allowed to fly at the maximum possible speed, in order to meet an arrival time target.

127
The name of the operation with the applicable operation ID (tactical function) for the specified formation (empty string if none).
128
Value of "original executed mission order ID" from the permanent memory of the specified formation.
129
The applicable executed mission order ID for the specified formation is the executed mission order ID by it - if it is not empty, otherwise it is the "original executed mission order ID" value stored in the formation's memory. Note: the "original executed mission order ID" value is stored in the memory of a formation created as part of a formation split, so as not to lose its link to the mission order executed by the original formation.
