1. Definitions
- "Actual mission type" is the actual fire support mission type (doctrinal function).
- "Applicable allocation constraints" (boolean) if the value of the applicable ammunition allocation constraints (doctrinal function) for the executing weapons platform group for the benefit of the actual supported force (doctrinal function) is 'yes'.
- "Allocation constraints" are the allocated artillery ammunition constraints (doctrinal function) for the executing weapons platform group for the "actual mission type".
- "Insufficient allocation" (boolean) if "applicable allocation constraints" and also not all the shells in the specified ammunition composition (standing order) can be fired under the "allocation constraints".
-  "Availability constraints" are the available artillery ammunition constraints (atomic function) for the executing weapons platform group. These constraints are derived from the inventory of shells in the executing weapons platform group and in nearby friendly weapons platform groups (Alpha APCs, ammunition trucks, ammunition stacks, etc.).
- "Insufficient availability" (boolean) if not all the shells in the specified ammunition composition (standing order) can be fired under the "availability constraints".
- "Ammunition composition that can be fired under allocation and availability constraints" is the intersection of the specified ammunition composition (standing order) with the "allocation constraints" and with the "availability constraints"

3. If the "ammunition composition that can be fired under allocation and availability constraints" includes at least one shell - perform indirect fire of a standing order (implementation) of the "ammunition composition that can be fired under allocation and availability constraints".

1. Definitions
- "Known detections" collection is a collection of known enemy detections (doctrinal function) of the specified supported force.
- "Suitable targets for firing" collection includes the weapons platform groups from the "known detections" collection that meet all the following conditions:
   + It is not destroyed
   + It is within the specified "targets area"
   + Its distance from the executing weapons platform group does not exceed its indirect firing range.
- A target (an enemy weapons platform group) is considered "safe" for firing if there is no weapons platform group belonging to the same army at a distance less than the safety range for indirect fire (doctrinal function) from it.

2. In each iteration:
- Select a "selected target" for engagement from among all the targets in the "suitable targets for firing" collection that have not yet been engaged. If a "reference route for prioritizing targets" is specified - this is the target closest to it, otherwise it is the first target in the collection (arbitrary selection).
- If the "selected target" is considered "safe" then
       +  Perform indirect fire for a required effect (doctrinal command) on it according to the specified "required effect" and "supported force".
       +  Mark the target and its neighboring targets (all the targets within the range of an artillery target size (radius) - doctrinal function) as having been engaged.
  Otherwise - mark only the target as having been engaged, so that it will be possible to move on to examining a new target in the next iteration.

3. At the end of an engagement round (when there are no more targets in the "suitable targets for firing" collection that have not yet been engaged) - perform a wait for the duration of a break between engagement rounds (doctrinal constant) and start a new round.

1. Definitions
- The "fire coverage circle" of an artillery weapons platform group is a circle whose center is at the unit's location and whose radius is equal to its "effective indirect firing range" (atomic function).
- The "fire coverage rate" (a number in the range 0-100) of an artillery weapons platform group for a route is the part of the route (in percent) that passes within its "fire coverage circle".
- The "available supporting artillery weapons platform groups" collection includes all the artillery weapons platform groups belonging to the supporting fire units (atomic function) of the executing unit and are not reserved.
- The "available subordinate artillery weapons platform groups" collection includes all the specified "subordinate artillery weapons platform groups" that are not reserved.
- The "potential artillery weapons platform groups" collection is a concatenation of
   + the "available subordinate artillery weapons platform groups" collection, sorted in descending order of their "fire coverage rate" for the specified "route to be covered by fire".
   + the "available supporting artillery weapons platform groups" collection, sorted in descending order as above.

2. Go over the "potential artillery weapons platform groups" collection to find a sub-collection of "suitable artillery weapons platform groups" (while maintaining the order) that includes only the weapons platform groups Ui that meet all the following conditions:
- Ui covers the specified route to be covered by fire with fire (doctrinal function - an artillery weapons platform group covers a route)
- The combined artillery ammunition constraints (doctrinal function) of Ui are ammunition constraints that allow for suppression and attrition (doctrinal function)
- Ui is not active (i.e., it is in a "taking up positions" activity). This limitation is intended to prevent the reservation of a weapons platform group that is performing some activity at the user's initiative (in particular, firing/movement).
- Ui supports the executing unit (the unit is contained by subordinate artillery weapons platform groups, or the unit supported by a superordinate allocated fire unit of Ui contains the executing unit).

3. Perform "reserve a unit" on the "suitable artillery weapons platform groups" sub-collection if it is not empty with the specified "note for receiving the reserved weapons platform group" and "job ID".
