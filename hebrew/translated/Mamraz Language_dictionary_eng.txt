Split a weapon systems group
355
Splitting the weapon systems group that receives the command by creating a new weapon systems group that contains the departing vehicles/soldiers, together with the inventory that "belongs" to them in proportion to their number, while adhering to the "law of conservation of matter". The new weapon systems group is created under the parent unit of the weapon systems group that receives the command.
356
Number of leavers
357
The number of vehicles leaving the weapon systems group - in case it is vehicle-based, the number of soldiers leaving - in case it is infantry-based.
358
Create a new weapon systems group
359
Creating a new weapon systems group "from scratch". If the receiving unit is a framework - the new weapon systems group is created under it, if it is a weapon systems group - the new weapon systems group is created under the first framework above it.
360
Weapon systems group type
361
The class name (under UN_SIMPLE) that represents the type of the weapon systems group to be created.
362
Number of individuals
363
The number of vehicles in the new weapon systems group - in case of a vehicle-based unit, the number of soldiers - in case of an infantry-based unit.
364
Location
365
The location where the new weapon systems group should be placed.
366
Name suffix
367
The "net" name suffix of the new weapon systems group, without the name components taken from the names of the commanding units. If not specified - the name suffix will be determined according to the default rules for naming units.
368
Create a new framework
369
Creating a new empty unit framework under the receiving unit, at its current location.
370
Echelon
371
The echelon of the framework unit to be created.
372
Framework type
373
The type of the framework unit to be created (e.g., company, division, battery, column) - from which its echelon is also implied. An echelon or a framework type must be specified, but not both.
374
Name suffix
375
The "net" name suffix of the new unit, without the name components taken from the names of the commanding units. If not specified - the name suffix will be determined according to the default rules for naming units.
376
Cancel unit
377
Cancellation of the receiving unit and its deletion from the unit tree.
378
Destruction of a weapon systems group
379
Updating the status of the receiving weapon systems group so that it will be considered "destroyed" - as defined by the UnitIsDefunct atomic function.
380
Change name
381
Changing the name of the receiving unit. The name is limited to 8 characters at most.
382
Name
383
Change the suffix to the name
384
Changing the suffix to the name of the receiving unit.
385
Suffix to the name
386
Set simulation frequency
387
Setting the simulation frequency of the weapon systems group. A weapon systems group that operates at a high frequency is updated at relatively short time intervals (partial steps) on an ongoing basis, according to the flow of time on the real clock. A weapon systems group that operates at a regular (not high) frequency is updated at relatively long time intervals (steps), during the calculation of a time step only. Note: the current simulation frequency of a weapon systems group (duration of a partial step/step) is returned by the UnitSimulationCycleLength atomic function.
388
High frequency
389
Activate conversation generation rule
390
Activation of the specified conversation generation rule.
391
Rule (class name)
392
The class name of the rule to be activated for the unit.
393
Preferred speakers
394
A collection of weapon systems groups from which speakers should be chosen with first priority.
395
Set the activity status of networks
396
Setting the activity status of a collection of networks from among all the networks of the unit (networks for which the unit is the "owner of the network") to the specified activity status. The collection includes every network Ni of the unit that meets the criteria defined by the filtering parameters (all are optional): - If a network type is specified - the type of Ni belongs to the specified network type. - If an inclusive tag is specified (hereinafter I) - the collection of tags (TAGS) that characterizes the type of Ni includes at least one tag of a type belonging to I. - If an exclusive tag is specified (hereinafter E) - the collection of tags that characterizes the type of Ni does not include any tag of a type belonging to E. Omitting a filtering parameter means that the corresponding criterion is not taken into account. In particular, if no filtering parameter is specified - the collection of affected networks includes all the networks of the unit.

Activity status
401
Activation of a conversation generation rule in the past
402
Activation of the specified conversation generation rule in the past, for the purpose of generating "historical" past conversations.
403
Rule (class name)
404
The class name of the rule to be activated for the unit.
405
Preferred speakers
406
A collection of weapon systems groups from which speakers should be chosen with first priority.
407
Activation time
408
The time in the past at which the rule should be activated.
409
Self-speaker location
410
The reference location for the weapon systems group on which the command was activated (the "pivot unit") in every conversation activated by the rule in which it appears as a speaker. If no value is specified - the current location is valid.
411
Other speaker location
412
The reference location for any other weapon systems group apart from the "pivot unit" in every conversation activated by the rule. If no value is specified - the current location is valid.
413
Distribution of past conversations
414
- Collection of all past conversations saved in all the weapon systems groups belonging to the executing unit and their deletion from the collection. - Scheduling of all the collected past conversations. - Distribution of the scheduled past conversations through the interface.
