136
Preferred means
137
The preferred means for the movement.
If a vehicle type was specified and there is an available vehicle of this type within the superordinate formation that has sufficient capacity and is at a reasonable distance - the movement will be performed using it, otherwise - the movement will be performed on foot or by vehicle - according to the distance and the availability of vehicles within the superordinate formation.

145
1. If the distance from the unit to the target does not exceed the "preferred walking distance" and no "preferred means" other than "foot" was explicitly specified - foot movement will be performed, otherwise - mounted movement will be performed if it is possible.

2. For mounted movement, a "transport unit" (a small wheeled vehicle type weapons platform group) must be found that belongs to the superordinate formation and meets all the following conditions:
a. It is available, i.e., it is not reserved for transporting another unit.
b. It is close enough, i.e., its distance from the unit does not exceed the "maximum distance to a transport unit"
c. It has sufficient capacity to carry the unit's soldiers. As a last resort, a transport unit capable of carrying at least the "minimum percentage of soldiers to be transported" of the unit's soldiers can also be used, which means a split: the soldiers for whom there is no room in the transport unit will be left behind and will not reach the target.

3. If a "preferred means" other than "foot" was specified - there is a preference (but not a necessity) for choosing a transport unit with a vehicle of this type.

4. If a transport unit is found, it immediately moves to the "pickup point" - which is the closest point to the unit that it can reach by movement (best effort). If after the end of the transport unit's movement it turns out in retrospect that using it is not worthwhile (the distance to be walked to the "pickup point" exceeds the distance to be walked to the target) - the services of the transport unit are waived and foot movement is performed.

5. If a "required arrival time" was specified, the departure time (start of movement) is determined based on an estimate of the total movement duration to the target, taking into account the typical movement speed of the means (vehicle/foot) used for each section of the road.

6. In case of mounted movement, the order of operations is:
a. Foot movement of the unit to the "pickup point".
b. Mounting the vehicles of the transport unit.
c. If a transit point was specified - movement of the transport unit to the transit point on a best-effort basis, and waiting for the "wait duration at a transit point".
d. Movement of the transport unit to the target on a best-effort basis.
e. Dismounting from the vehicles of the transport unit.
f. Foot movement to the target if necessary.
146
