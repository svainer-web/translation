Indirect fire for required effect (weapon systems group)
2
Performing indirect fire to achieve a required effect on a target. The ammunition composition and firing duration are determined according to the target type and the required effect according to the definitions of applicable fire missions (from the external parameters database) for the type of indirect fire system of the executing weapon systems group. If no applicable fire mission is defined - an arbitrary fire mission is chosen as a default.

1. Definitions - "Actual mission type" is the actual fire support mission type (doctrinal function). - "Combined ammunition constraints" are the combined artillery ammunition constraints (doctrinal function) that apply to the executing weapon systems group, when firing for the specified supported force for the purpose of the "actual mission type". 2. If at least one applicable fire mission is defined [in the external parameters database] for the indirect fire system type of the executing weapon systems group for the purpose of achieving the specified "required effect" on the specified "target type" - set the "actual fire mission for firing" to the most suitable (achievable) fire mission among all the applicable fire missions under the "combined ammunition constraints", i.e., to the fire mission from which the highest percentage of shells can be fired (relative to the required quantity) under the constraints. Otherwise, execute: - Send an error message to the unit about an undefined fire mission. - Set the "actual fire mission for firing" to a default fire mission that includes one element arbitrarily determined according to the specified "required effect" as follows: + Illumination/smoke - 2 shells of the illumination/smoke type, with a 5-minute interval between shells. + Suppression and attrition - 6 shells of the high-explosive type or 3 shells of the cluster type, with no interval between shells (i.e., at the maximum firing rate), where the chosen shell type (high-explosive/cluster) is the one whose quantity in the "combined ammunition constraints" is greater. - If the "combined ammunition constraints" do not include any shell required by the default fire mission - send an error message to the unit about a lack of suitable ammunition for firing the default fire mission and terminate. 3. Perform indirect fire of a fire mission on the "actual fire mission for firing".
