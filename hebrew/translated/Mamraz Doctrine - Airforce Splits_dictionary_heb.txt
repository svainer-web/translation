19
1. Perform "split ammunition group" with "number of leavers" equal to the specified "number of splitting aircraft", for the purpose of "birthing" a new formation. For the avoidance of doubt: the new formation is not linked to a mission order.

2. Send a "post-split execution order" event to the new formation.

3. Perform "change suffix to name" to "call sign numbering", equal to the series of digits from L to L+N-1 (for example: "Nimrod12") where:
- L is the "leader number" (tactical function)
- N is the number of remaining aircraft (the initial number of aircraft minus the number of splitting aircraft, in the example: 2).

4. Perform "send message" (self) of type "warning without handling": "[number of splitting aircraft] aircraft have split from [name of the original formation]".

31
1. Set the "leader number" (hereinafter L) to the "leader number" (tactical function) of the original formation plus the number of aircraft (current, after the split) in the original formation.

2. Perform the following commands:

a. "Change suffix to name" to "call sign numbering", equal to the series of digits from L to L+N-1 (for example: "Nimrod34") where:
- L is the "leader number" (tactical function) of the original formation plus the number of aircraft in the original formation (in the example: 2)
- N is the number of aircraft in the executing formation (in the example: 2).

b. "Set timing instructions (atomic)" and "Set mission instructions (atomic)" with the corresponding parameter values in the original formation.

c. "Set transmission status" with the corresponding parameter values in the original formation.

d. "Set mission execution state" with:
- Execution state - "en route".
- Note for execution state - "after split.".

3. Remember "original operation ID" equal to the "applicable operation ID" (tactical function) of the original formation.
    Remember "original executed mission order ID" equal to the "applicable executed mission order ID" (tactical function) of the original formation.

4. Remember "first takeoff point" (see tactical function with this name) equal to the "first takeoff point" of the original formation.

5. Perform "send message" (self) of type "warning without handling": "The formation has split from [name of the original formation]".

6. Perform "flight along a path (atomic)" with:
 - "Path" starting at the current location of the original formation, of "path length before separation" and in the current [flight] direction of the original formation + "separation angle".
 - "Initial speed" equal to the current speed of the original formation.
 - "Initial altitude" equal to the current altitude of the original formation.

7. If there is a need to fly to a target in the air (a "target in the air" coordinate was specified and also self-destruction should not be performed) - perform "arrival at coordinate" with:
- Coordinate - the specified "target coordinate in the air"
- Arrival time - empty
- Wait on arrival - 'no'
- Straight line to coordinate - the specified "straight line to target".

8. If self-destruction should be performed - perform "abandonment (implementation)" with the specified "target coordinate in the air" and "straight line to target" values.

9. If there is a need to land - perform "flight to landing" with
- Straight line to landing - the specified "straight line to target"
- Landing base - the actual landing base (the specified landing base or the closest base to the formation - if "land at nearby base" was specified).
- Landing strip - as specified
- Landing coordinate - as specified.

- Arrival time - empty
- Wait on arrival - 'no'
- Straight line to coordinate - the specified "straight line to abandonment".

2. Perform "set mission execution state" with execution state - "abandonment".
