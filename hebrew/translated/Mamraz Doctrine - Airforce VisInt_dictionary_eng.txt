0. Definitions - The target is considered to be in motion if it is a "live" detection that is in motion or if its current detection location is not empty and is different from its last detection location. - The base path for the UAV orbit should be changed if all the following conditions are met: + The target is not in full coverage [from the current base path for orbit]. + The value of "track from the path only" specified is 'no' + The target appears to be in motion 1. If the base path for the UAV orbit should be changed then - set the memory note "base path for UAV orbit" to "base path for orbiting a waypoint for a UAV" (doctrinal function) for the "known location of the target" - send a "change in base path for orbit by UAV" event. 2. - Set the memory note "target detection status in UAV tracking" to the target's detection status according to the operation's detection list. - Set the memory note "last detection location of UAV target" to the detection location of the target unit according to the operation's detection list. - Set the memory note "target for UAV tracking is in full coverage" to the value of "the target is in full coverage". 3. - If the "last detection status of the target" from the executing formation's memory is "live detection" and the "current detection status of the target" from the formation's memory is not "live detection" (the target was lost): send an information message of type "target in tracking was lost": "The target cannot be detected. Continuing to observe the location where it was last seen." - If the "last detection status of the target" is not "live detection" and the "current detection status of the target" is "live detection" (the target was re-acquired): send an information message of type "target in tracking was re-acquired": "The target has been re-acquired.

If leaving the observation flight path occurs: send an information message of type "UAV is leaving the observation flight path": "The target has moved. Leaving the defined observation flight path in order not to lose it." Change the value of "observation orbit radius" in the formation's memory to "typical UAV observation orbit radius" (doctrinal function). 5. If the value of "track from the path only" specified is 'yes': - If the value of "target for UAV tracking is in full coverage" in the formation's memory - 'yes' and also "the target is in full coverage" - 'no' (the target has left full coverage): send an information message of type "target in tracking has left full coverage": "The target has moved so that it is no longer in full coverage from the defined observation flight path. Continuing to track from the path, despite the coverage limitations." - If the value of "target for UAV tracking is in full coverage" in the formation's memory - 'no' and also "the target is in full coverage" (the target has returned to full coverage): send an information message of type "target in tracking has returned to full coverage": "The target has moved back into full coverage from the defined observation flight path."
