0. General definitions
- All messages sent as part of this command begin with the text "Refilling of supplying units: ".
- For the purpose of the execution, a new departmental formation is established under the command of the unit, to which all the participating weapons platform groups are subordinated. At the end of the execution, the departmental formation is disbanded and the participating weapons platform groups return to the command of the unit receiving the command.

1. The collection of participating weapons platform groups potentially includes any weapons platform group capable of supplying at least one inventory item belonging to one of the specified supply item families:
- If the quantity of the inventory in the weapons platform group relative to the standard is not less than the "full inventory percentage" for all the items it can fill, - "Unit [name] is already full (above "full inventory percentage") in [item families] and therefore will not participate in the execution of the command." should be announced.
- Otherwise, if the quantity of the inventory in the weapons platform group relative to the standard is not less than the "partial inventory percentage" for all the items it can fill - "Unit [name] will participate in the execution even though it is partially full (above "partial inventory percentage") in [item families]." should be announced.

2. The actual arrival route is the "route to the supply point" - if specified, otherwise - a route that starts at the location of the first participating weapons platform group and ends at the location of the supplying unit.

3. If no route was specified and the calculated route does not reach within the "maximum refill range" (doctrinal function) of the supplying unit's location: the command planning must be failed.

4. The expected movement duration is derived from the movement capabilities of the participating weapons platform groups (according to the slowest among them) and the planned arrival route, plus a "safety factor for movement duration" (doctrinal function).

5. The preferred departure time is equal to the arrival time (if specified) minus the expected movement duration. The actual departure time is the later of the current time and the preferred departure time.

6. If the actual departure time is greater than the current time, a message is sent to the department - "The planned departure time is [actual departure time]".

7. When the actual departure time arrives:
- A message is sent to the department - "Starting movement to the supply point".
- A departmental movement is performed in a column formation along the arrival route.

8. At the end of the movement, if the closest participating weapons platform group to the supply point is farther from it than the "refill range", then a message is sent to the department: "I could not reach the planned supply point. To allow refilling, the supplying unit must be brought closer to my current location." Otherwise, a message is sent to the department - "I have reached the supply point. Starting to refill."

9. For each item family, the total percentage of the inventory in the department is remembered as the "initial percentage".

10. For each of the participating weapons platform groups, a series of "refill to standard" commands is performed - a command for each of the specified item families.

11. After the completion of the execution of the series of "refill to standard" commands by all the participating weapons platform groups, a message is sent to the department for each item family that was required to be filled:
- If the total percentage of the facility's inventory has increased compared to the "before percentage" (success): "The percentage of [item family] of the facility has increased from [before percentage] to [after percentage].
- If the total percentage of the facility's inventory has not increased compared to the "before percentage" (failure): "Cannot fill [item family]. No supplying unit was found belonging to [name of the supplying unit] close enough (["refill range"]) that contains the required inventory and is in a "preparing to provide supply" state.

12. If there was at least one failure:
- The "end time for repeated attempts" is set to the current time value + "duration of performing repeated attempts".
- A message is sent: "Continuing to try to refill for an hour (until ["end time for repeated attempts"]).
- A loop is executed as long as the "end time for repeated attempts" has not been reached and "there is a reason to wait"
     + "Refill to standard" commands are executed with all the specified item families as above.
     + If the total percentage of the facility's inventory of at least one item family is not greater than the "initial percentage" of this family - "there is a reason to wait"
     + Wait for the "wait duration between repeated attempts".
- The messages of step 10 are repeated, omitting the tedious description of the reason for cases of failure.

13. A message is sent to the department "Starting to move back to the battalion" and a departmental movement is performed in a column along the actual arrival route in the opposite direction - from its end to its starting point, up to the department's starting point.

14. At the end of the movement, a message is sent to the department: "I have finished executing the command " and the department is disbanded.
