Truncated expected attacker route
24
Expected attacker route, truncated according to the sector boundaries. The truncated parts are:
- The beginning of the route that is outside the sector boundaries, beyond twice the "length of the external search segment on the attacker route" (doctrinal function) from the route's entry point into the sector boundaries.
- The end of the route that exits the sector boundaries.
The working assumption is that the attacker's route necessarily enters the sector boundaries but does not necessarily exit them.

- "Enemy units were found within firing range" if there are enemy units within the direct firing range of the executing unit.
- "Enemy units outside the routes" are the simple non-destroyed enemy units in the deployment area that are not at a distance less than half the "width of the exclusion area for a route" from the specified exclusion routes.
- "The closest enemy unit" is the enemy unit closest to the unit's location from the collection of "enemy units outside the routes".
- "Principle route to the closest enemy unit" is a route based on a straight line from the current location of the executing unit to the location of "the closest enemy unit".
- "Principle route segment to the closest enemy unit" is a segment of the principle route at the "rate of movement from the route per iteration", with a length not exceeding the "maximum movement distance" and not less than the minimum of the "minimum movement distance" and the distance of the enemy unit.
- "The actual route to the closest enemy unit" is a route to "the closest enemy unit", whose length is limited to the distance that the executing unit can move in a time step at its typical speed.
- "Move to an enemy unit" if the unit has no potential targets (doctrinal function), the collection of "enemy units outside the routes" is not empty and "the actual route to the closest enemy unit" is not empty.
- "Activate reserve for the first time" - 'yes'

2. Remember the current time.

3. If "move to an enemy unit" is 'no': perform "timed occupation of firing positions" for a duration of two time steps.

4. If "move to an enemy unit" is 'yes':
a. If the "interception activated" value in the unit's memory is 'no' ("first interception"): remember in the unit's memory "interception activated" - 'yes' and perform "activate reserve team activation report rule" with parameters corresponding to "the closest enemy unit".
b. "Perform concealed movement" on the "principle route segment to the closest enemy unit" with an end mode - 'at target' and "on encounter" - 'continue'.

5. Perform "direct fire".

6. If "move to an enemy unit" and the current time saved in step 2 has not passed: perform "timed occupation of firing positions" for a duration of one second.
