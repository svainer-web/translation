A raw attack results report describes the quality of the impact of a discrete munition and the rate of damage caused by it to the target (BDA - Bomb Damage Assessment), subject to the executing formation's ability (which does not always exist) to assess it.
In practice, an attack results report is also used to report the results of a scan for preliminary detection of targets (before an attack) and to report the results of a dedicated scan for BDA (after an attack).

Activate an airborne detection system
89
Activating an airborne detection system (from the systems available in the unit's inventory) for the purpose of scanning a defined circular area and updating the detection list according to the scan results.
The initial scan results (updating the detection list) are received immediately. The detection list continues to be updated continuously, until a "turn off airborne detection system" command is executed.
The working assumption is that only one detection system can be active at any given moment, therefore activating a detection system causes an implicit turning off of the current active system - if there is one.

Following the turning off of the system, the detection list stops being updated with live detections/ the detections that were produced by the turned-off detection system may remain for a limited period in the list as past detections - according to the "past detection lifetime" characteristic of the detection system type.
98
UAV scan focus
99
Focusing a UAV's scanning system in one of the following ways:
- Focusing on a fixed N.P., by specifying a "N.P. for focus" value.
- Focusing on a weapons platform group, by specifying a "weapons platform group for focus" value. The focus point changes as needed according to the movement of the weapons platform group.
- Focusing on one's own location, which means that the scanning system is directed towards the ground so that the focus point is equal at every moment to the UAV's current location. This focusing method is implied in case no "N.P. for focus" value was specified and no "weapons platform group for focus" value was specified.
100
N.P. for focus
101
If a value is specified - the scan should be focused on this point.
102
Weapons platform group for focus
103
If a value is specified - the scan should be focused on this weapons platform group. In particular, this means that the focus point should be moved according to its movement.
