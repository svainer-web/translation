In practice, an attack results report is also used to report the results of a scan for the preliminary detection of targets (before an attack) and to report the results of a dedicated scan for BDA (after an attack).

109
Focus scan for a UAV
110
Focusing the scanning system of a UAV in one of the following ways: - Focusing on a fixed waypoint, by specifying a "waypoint for focus" value. - Focusing on a weapon systems group, by specifying a "weapon systems group for focus" value. The focus point changes as needed according to the movement of the weapon systems group. - Focusing on a self-location, which means that the scanning system is directed towards the ground so that the focus point is equal at all times to the current location of the UAV. This focusing method is implied in case no "waypoint for focus" value is specified and also no "weapon systems group for focus" value is specified.
