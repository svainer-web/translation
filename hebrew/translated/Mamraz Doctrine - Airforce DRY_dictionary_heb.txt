Entire Unit
14
Flight approval in threat zone
15
How to treat a threat zone when planning flight paths for the formation.
17
Attack profile
18
The profile according to which the targets should be attacked.
19
Set anchor time of a formation (land)
20
Last takeoff time
21
Set anchor event of a formation (land)
22
Anchor event of a formation
23
Set last takeoff time (land)
24
Set first takeoff point (land)
25
Dry substitute.
26
First takeoff point
32
Flight along a path (atomic) (land)
33
Path
34
The path along which to fly.
35
Initial speed
36
The initial speed (relative to the ground) at which the flight begins - in knots. If not specified - the flight begins at the current speed.
37
Initial altitude
38
The absolute altitude (above sea level) at which the flight begins - in thousands of feet. If not specified - the flight begins at the current altitude.
39
Land at the end
40
Whether to land (i.e. descend to ground level) at the end point of the specified path.
41
In case of not landing at the end, the flight end altitude is arbitrarily set to the desired flight altitude.
42
Takeoff
43
Takeoff (anchor)
44
Landing
45
Set flight characteristics (atomic) (land)
46
Altitude
47
The desired absolute flight altitude (above sea level) in thousands of feet. If no value is specified - the desired flight altitude remains unchanged.
48
Speed
49
The desired flight speed relative to the ground - in knots. If not specified - the desired flight speed remains unchanged.
50
Flight pattern
51
The flight pattern in which to fly. If not specified - the current flight pattern is maintained.
52
Set mission instructions (atomic) (land)
53
Delivery policy
54
The delivery policy for ordnance.
55
Perform ground verification
56
Whether to perform a ground verification report for the targeting points intended for attack before the first takeoff.
57
Fly without fuel warnings
58
Whether to fly without warning about low fuel situations (sonol/bingo).
59
Set timing instructions (atomic) (land)
60
Existing alert state
61
Alert is a state in which the executing formation is required to wait on the ground for a scramble command, which may precede the planned takeoff time. The existing alert level determines the response time in which the formation is required to meet - between receiving the scramble command and the actual takeoff.
62
Alert start time
63
The existing alert is valid only from this time.
64
Scramble time
65
The time at which the scramble command was received for the formation on alert.
66
Planned first takeoff time
67
The planned time for the formation's first takeoff as part of the mission.
68
Anchor time
69
The time at which the mission's anchor event is required to occur.
70
Anchor event
71
The type of the mission's main event - according to which the entire mission is scheduled.
72
Anchor event location
73
The expected location of the formation when the anchor event occurs. During the execution of the flight plan, a continuous assessment of the ability to reach this location at the anchor time is performed, and an alert is issued if a delay is expected.
74
The last takeoff time performed by the formation.
75
Required alert state
76
The alert state to which the formation is required to transition in case of an alert change. The completion of the transition is expressed by setting the value of the existing alert state to the required alert state.
77
Wait (land)
78
Wait duration
79
If no wait duration is specified - the command will end immediately.
80
Wait description
81
If a value is specified - a message is sent to the unit in the format "[Wait description] ([Wait duration])".
82
Remember the "End time". Wait until the "End time" arrives.
83
Save anchor event (land)
84
Anchor event
85
Arrival time
86
The arrival time at the end of the flight path. If not specified - the actual arrival time is the current time.
87
Prepare for dry run
88
Initialize the memory notes that embody the dynamic state of the unit for a dry run, based on the values of its dynamic attributes.
