Requested quantity
36
Response to refueling request
37
Response sent by a refueler formation to a refuelee formation in response to receiving a "refueling request" event from it. A zero value in "approved quantity for refueling" constitutes a refusal indicating that the refueler formation is not available. The value of "is on approach for landing" allows the refuelee formation to know if the reason for the refusal is that the refueler is on approach for landing or that the available fuel for refueling has run out.
38
Approved quantity for transfer
39
Is on approach for landing
40
The formation is not available for refueling because it is on approach for landing. A 'no' value when the "approved quantity for transfer" is zero indicates that the available fuel for refueling has run out.
41
Response to refueling request
42
In response to a refueling request, the availability of the refueler formation for refueling is checked and an appropriate response is sent to the refuelee formation. If the response is "positive" - the approved quantity for transfer is deducted from the refueler formation's inventory.
43
Available fuel for refueling has run out
44
Send to the requesting formation a "response to refueling request" with a refusal for the reason "fuel has run out"

57
Refueler formation
58
The formation from which the fuel will be received. The refueling route is the current route of the refueler formation.
59
The type of the refueler formation is not suitable for refueling the executing formation.
60
Additional fuel (work time)
61
Jet fuel quantity (in minutes) = work time to be filled during refueling. If no value is specified - the additional work time will be determined according to the typical default for the platform type.
62
In the first iteration only: 1. Set "actual additional work time" to the specified "additional work time" - if specified, otherwise - to the "default for additional work time in in-flight refueling" for the formation. 2. Set "required additional fuel" to the "fuel quantity required for flight" (doctrinal function) by the formation for the duration of the "actual additional work time". 3. Store in the formation's memory the "target quantity" equal to the minimum of the maximum possible "jet fuel (lbs)" quantity for the formation and (the current inventory quantity in the formation plus the "required additional fuel"). 4. If the current flight altitude of the refueler is higher than the maximum flight altitude of the formation, or if the current flight speed of the refueler is not within the practical speed range for the formation - send appropriate warning messages to the formation and continue with the execution. 5. If the distance to the refueler formation exceeds the "refueling start range" - execute "set mission execution status" to "en route". In each iteration: 1. If the distance to the refueler formation exceeds the "refueling start range" and refueling has not yet begun - if the distance to the formation exceeds the "high speed range" - the "flight speed" is the typical flight speed (in knots), otherwise it is the maximum of the typical flight speed and the current flight speed of the refueler formation multiplied by the "high speed factor" (but not higher than the "maximum practical flight speed (in knots)"). If the distance to the refueler formation is less than the "maximum distance for high speed" or if refueling has already begun - the "flight speed" is the current flight speed of the refueler formation. 2. Execute "set flight characteristics (atomic)" with an 'altitude' value equal to the minimum of the refueler's altitude and the maximum possible flight altitude for the formation. 3. Execute "scheduled flight along a path" at the "flight speed" to the "target path", which is the "path to the refueler" truncated to the "maximum length of the target path". The "path to the refueler" is: if the value of "fuel transfer has begun" is 'no' - "operational air route from current vector" (doctrinal function) to the current location of the refueler formation, otherwise - a straight line from the current location of the executing formation to the current location of the refueler formation. The "maximum length of the target path" is the "distance according to speed and time" (doctrinal function) at the "flight speed" and "dedicated flight duration in iteration". 4. If the distance to the refueler formation does not exceed the "refueling start range" and the value of "fuel transfer has begun" is 'no' ("start of refueling") execute: - Remember the value "fuel transfer has begun" = 'yes'. - Store in the formation's memory the "total quantity to transfer" equal to the "target quantity" (from the formation's memory) minus the current jet fuel (lbs) quantity. - Set the "number of rounds" to the number of aircraft in the formation divided by the "number of refueling points in a refueler formation" (doctrinal function) and rounded up. - Store in the formation's memory the "total refueling duration" equal to the "number of rounds" multiplied by the "in-flight refueling duration from a refueler formation" typical for the refueler formation. - Execute "set mission execution status" to "in in-flight refueling". 5. If "fuel transfer has begun" or "start of refueling" - 'yes': execute "send refueling request" with a "flight start time" value equal to the current time.
63
The current fuel quantity in the formation has reached the "target quantity" up to an epsilon (the fuel consumption for the distance of the refueling start range at the minimum speed) or the "refueler is not available" or "fuel transfer has begun" already and the distance to the refueler is greater than 3 nautical miles (refueling stop range) or the refueler is not in the air
64
The epsilon is intended to prevent a "vicious circle" that may occur towards the end of the refueling due to the fact that after requesting the missing quantity at the end of an iteration, one continues to fly and consume more fuel in the next iteration.
