Application principles:

1. Do not open fire on targets at a range exceeding 2/3 of the effective firing range (assuming it is difficult to be accurate when firing at distant targets while moving).

2. The list of potential targets includes only enemy units with a discrimination level of "recognition" at least.

3. The potential targets are prioritized for firing as follows:
+ All targets of the maneuvering/assaulting type have priority over all targets that are not of the maneuvering/assaulting type
+ The targets of each group are prioritized among themselves according to proximity.

4. If direct fire is sustained that caused casualties or the shooter is of the armor/anti-tank type (even if the fire did not cause casualties) - return fire on the shooter with top priority (even if the shooter is at a range greater than 2/3 of the effective range). The shooter is included in the detection list in any case, so that even if he is not fired upon with top priority, the other rules still apply to him.

5.  In any case, do not fire on more than 4 targets simultaneously.

380
The forced end time has arrived or
the potential for mounting vehicles has been exhausted (no available foot units are left or no transport units* are left with space on them)
 and there are no busy foot units (waiting for pickup)
381
The existence of a free space for transporting soldiers in busy transport units intentionally "delays" the end of the command.
This is due to the fact that in case of a split of a transport unit (in the process of "mounting vehicles" of the foot unit on it), a temporary situation may arise in which there is a transport unit with free space but it is still busy because it has not yet had time to finish executing the "pickup of a foot unit" command.
382
In each iteration:
Distribute instructions for the pickup of available mounted units by available transport units - if there are any.

392
This command is intended to prevent the end of the current iteration and the beginning of the next iteration, before the event reporting the selection of the transport unit is handled (and in particular before the list of available transport units is updated).
394
In case the transport unit's route does not reach the mounted unit (due to a passability problem), it is shortened slightly - to prevent a "jam" in the movement later - in an attempt to leave the point where the passability problem exists.
395
