228
Departure Alert Follower Unit
229

230
1. If the distance from the unit to the destination does not exceed the "Preferred Walking Distance" and a "Preferred Means" other than "Dismounted" was not explicitly specified - dismounted movement will be performed, otherwise - vehicular movement will be performed if possible.

2. For vehicular movement, a "carrier unit" (a small wheeled vehicle type weapons systems group) must be found that belongs to the superior's framework and meets all the following conditions:
a. It is available, meaning it is not reserved for transporting another unit.
b. It is close enough, meaning its distance from the unit does not exceed the "maximum distance to a carrier unit"
c. It has sufficient capacity to carry the unit's soldiers.
As a last resort, a carrier unit capable of carrying at least a "minimum percentage of soldiers to be transported" from the unit's soldiers can be used, which implies splitting: the soldiers for whom there is no room in the carrier unit will remain behind and will not reach the destination.
3. If a "Preferred Means" other than "Dismounted" is specified - there is a preference (but not a requirement) for selecting a carrier unit with a vehicle of this type.
4. If a carrier unit is found, it moves immediately to the "Pickup Point" - which is the closest point to the unit that it is able to reach in movement (best effort).
If after the carrier unit's movement is complete, it turns out in retrospect that its use is not advantageous (the distance to walk to the "Pickup Point" exceeds the distance to walk to the destination) - the services of the carrier unit are foregone, and dismounted movement is performed.
5. If a "Required Time of Arrival" is specified, the departure time (start of movement) is determined based on an estimation of the total movement duration to the destination, considering the typical movement speed of the means (vehicle/dismounted) used for each segment of the route.
6. In the case of vehicular movement, the sequence of actions is:
a. Dismounted movement of the unit to the "Pickup Point".
b. Mounting the carrier unit's vehicles.
c. If a waypoint is specified - movement of the carrier unit to the waypoint on a best-effort basis, and waiting for the "Dwell Time at Waypoint".
d. Movement of the carrier unit to the destination on a best-effort basis.
e. Dismounting from the carrier unit's vehicles.
f. Dismounted movement to the destination as needed.
