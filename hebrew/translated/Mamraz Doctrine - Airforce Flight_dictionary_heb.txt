3
Required time gain
4
The amount of time that needs to be "wasted" in the orbit.
5
1. Gaining time by a complete orbit is always performed at the current flight speed.

2. Performing a complete orbit allows for a continuous and finite range of time gain, as follows:

a. The minimum time gain is achieved by a circular orbit at the current speed.

b. The maximum time gain is achieved by a hippodrome orbit ("popsicle stick") at the minimum practical speed (tactical function), with a straight leg of "maximum straight leg length".

c. The continuous range between (a) and (b) is achieved by extending the straight leg of the hippodrome orbit up to the "maximum straight leg length".

3. The actual time gain is determined as follows: if the required time gain is greater than the maximum time gain - it is the maximum time gain, otherwise it is the required time gain.

18
Perform orbits to gain time, so that the flight vector at the end (location and direction) is equal to the initial flight vector.
19
1. In the first iteration: Remember the "target time for ending time gain" as the current time plus "required time gain".

In each iteration:
2. "Remaining required time gain" equals the time difference between "target time for ending time gain" and the current time.

3. If "minimum time gain in orbit" (tactical func.) is not greater than "remaining required time gain" (need to gain time): perform a single orbit to gain time with "remaining required time gain".

1. General definitions
- The "actual speed" is the specified "ground speed" - if specified, otherwise - the typical flight speed (tactical function) for the formation.
- The "actual flight pattern" is the specified "flight pattern" - if specified, otherwise if the formation is landed (tactical function) - "takeoff", otherwise - "cruise".
- The formation is considered to have "not yet performed first takeoff" if the value of formation has performed first takeoff (tactical function) for it is 'no'.
- The value "takeoff required" is 'yes' if the formation is landed (tactical function).
- The "base path" is the "flight path for threat zone monitoring" if there is a new threat zone on the flight path, otherwise it is the specified path.

2. How to calculate the "actual path"
- The "intercept target point" is the closest point to the formation on the specified "path".
- "Direct intercept possible" if the formation is allowed to intercept a path directly (tactical function) based on the "intercept target point".
- The "turning radius" is the turning radius (nautical miles) (tactical function) of the formation at the "actual speed".
- The "direct intercept path" is a conditional intercept path (tactical function) from the current location and direction of the formation to the specified "path", based on the "turning radius".
- The "indirect intercept path" is an operational air path from the current vector (tactical function) of the formation to the "intercept target point", with a "landing" value of 'no', "straight line" - 'no', "speed" - the "actual speed".
- The "intercept path" is the "direct intercept path" - if "direct intercept is possible", otherwise it is the "indirect intercept path".
- The "intercept point" is the last point of the "intercept path".
- The "target path" is the final segment of the specified "path", starting from the "intercept point".
- The "path without threat zone avoidance" is determined as follows:
If "takeoff is required" and the current location of the formation is equal to the start point of the specified "path" - it is the specified "path",
otherwise - it is a glued air path (tactical function) from the "intercept path" and the "target path" based on the "turning radius".
- The "path including threat zone avoidance" is based on threat zone avoidance for an existing path (tactical function) on the "path without threat zone avoidance".
- The "actual path" is determined as follows:
If "there is a new threat zone on the flight path" (an indication in the permanent memory that was turned on by the mission/unit response rule "response to a new threat zone on a monitored flight path") - it is the "path including threat zone avoidance", otherwise it is the "path without threat zone avoidance".

3. If "takeoff is required", perform:

a. If the executed mission order value (atomic function) of the formation is not empty and also (the formation "has not yet performed first takeoff" or the value of the permanent memory note "send takeoff report (C2)" is 'yes') - send a takeoff report to the C2 system and set the value of the permanent memory note "send takeoff report (C2)" to 'no'.
Explanation: The permanent memory note "send takeoff report (C2)" is shared by this command and the "fly to land" command. The mechanism is intended to prevent sending takeoff reports to the C2 system following "occasional" landings and takeoffs - that were not planned in advance in the C2 system.

b. If the value of the permanent memory note "first takeoff point" is empty - set it to the current location with the name of the nearby base - if there is one.

c. Set the value of the permanent memory note "last takeoff time" to the current time value, for use by the "check flight pattern" response rule.

4. If "there is a new threat zone on the flight path" and the "path including threat zone avoidance" is different from the "path without threat zone avoidance" - send a warning message to the formation. If the path has been significantly extended as a result of avoiding the threat zones - the message requires handling.

5. Perform "set flight characteristics" (tactical) for the purpose of setting the (desired) speed to the "actual speed" and the "flight pattern" to the "actual flight pattern".

6. Set the "there is a new threat zone on the flight path" indication in the formation's permanent memory to 'no'.

7. Perform "update flight path for threat zone monitoring" to the "actual path".

8. Perform "flight along a path (atomic)" on the "actual path" with a "land on arrival" value equal to the specified "land on arrival" value.

9. Perform "update flight path for threat zone monitoring" to an empty path (no need for monitoring).

10. At the beginning and end of the execution: perform the "set mission instructions (atomic)" command with a "full power flight authorized" value of 'no'.

Then:
a. "Full operational path to point" is "operational air path from current vector" (tactical function) to the specified "point", with a "straight line" value of 'no'.
b. "Base control circle" is a circle whose center is at the specified "point" and its radius is "base control radius (CTR)" (tactical function).
c. "Approach start point" is the last intersection point (hint: the first on the reverse path) of the "full operational path to point" with the "base control circle"
d. If "approach start point" is empty (meaning the formation is inside the circle) - the "actual path" is the "full operational path to point", otherwise - find the "actual path" as follows:
- "Path to start of approach" is "operational air path from current vector" (tactical function) to the "approach start point", with a "straight line" value of 'yes'.
- "Approach for landing path" is the final part of the "full operational path to point" - from the "approach start point" to its end.
- The "actual path" is a concatenation of the "path to start of approach" and the "approach for landing path", on which (on the concatenation) the "round turns for angular path" algorithm is applied, in order to round the connection between the two paths.
Explanation: The traffic rules that apply within the "base control circle" on landing, override the "straight line to point" instruction.

Otherwise,
The "actual path" is an "operational air path from current vector" (tactical function) to the specified "point" at the typical speed, where the "straight line" value passed to the function is according to the specified "straight line to point" value.

2. "Already there" = 'yes' if the formation's location is equal to the specified "point" and the specified "land on arrival" value is equal to the "landed formation" value (tactical function).

- The "actual speed" is the specified "ground speed" - if specified, otherwise - the typical flight speed (tactical function) for the formation.
- "Turning radius" is the turning radius (nautical miles) (tactical function) of the formation at the "actual speed".

In the first iteration only:
2. Calculate the "cyclic flight path for execution" based on the current direction and location of the formation relative to the actual cyclic flight path (as derived from the specified "base path" and "return on path" mode).

If the "return on path" mode is "orbit the path":
- The "actual orbit radius" is the "orbit radius", otherwise - it is the "turning radius".
- "Orbit intercept path" and "opposite orbit intercept path" are conditional intercept paths (tactical function) from the current location and direction of the formation to the "orbit path" and "opposite orbit path" respectively.
- If the "orbit intercept path" is not longer than the "opposite orbit intercept path", the "actual orbit path" is the "orbit path", otherwise it is the "opposite orbit path".

3. If the formation is not located on the "cyclic flight path for execution":
- Perform "set mission execution state" to "en route".
- Perform "scheduled flight along a path" on the "intercept path" with the specified "ground speed" and "flight pattern".
The "intercept path" is a conditional intercept path (tactical function) from the current location and direction of the formation to the "cyclic flight path for execution".

4. Perform "set mission execution state" to "stabilized".

5. If the formation is located on the path, the "actual cyclic flight path" is the "cyclic flight path for execution"
Otherwise it is the "intercepted cyclic flight path".

1. Definitions:

a. An "arbitrary holding path" is a path in the shape of a "popsicle stick" where:
     - The radius of the arcs is the turning radius at the typical flight speed for the platform type.
     - The length of the straight segment is equal to the radius of the arcs multiplied by 'turning radius to straight leg multiplier'.
     - The "popsicle stick" is located so that the formation (at its current location and direction) is at the end of its left straight segment,
    at the point where it is supposed to start turning right on the upper arc.

b. The "actual holding path" is the specified "holding path" - if it is not empty, otherwise - it is the straight line that forms the center spine of the "arbitrary holding path".

2. Save the "actual end time" in the formation's memory, which is:
     - The specified "end time" - if it is not empty, otherwise
     - The current time value plus the specified "wait duration" - if it is not empty, otherwise
     - An empty time value.

3. If a holding path is specified and the formation is not authorized to intercept it at its start point (tactical func. "formation is authorized to intercept path directly"):
- Perform "set mission execution state" to "en route".
- Perform flight to a point to the start of the specified holding path.

4. Perform "cyclic flight along a path" on the "actual holding path" with a "return on path" value of "orbit the path".

4. If the "actual end time" is not empty - the flight should be stopped when the end time is reached.
346

378
The sector cannot be inferred as neither "entry corridor" nor "holding area" were specified.
379
Wait on arrival
380
Whether to wait after arriving at the sector.
If no value is specified then:
- If "holding area" is specified - waiting will be performed.
- If "entry corridor" is specified - no waiting will be performed.
- If neither is specified - waiting will be determined by the attack profile as defined in the timing instructions: in hunt - yes, in supplies - no.
381
A 'no' value for "wait on arrival" contradicts the specification of "holding area".
382
Holding area
383

If no entry corridor is specified and the sector must be entered (no waiting on arrival was specified and no holding area was specified) - the entry will be performed through the entry corridor defined as preferred for entry to the sector.
387
An entry corridor belonging to the sector must be specified. Do not specify an entry corridor when waiting on arrival is required or a "holding area" is specified.
388
Waiting on arrival is required = a 'yes' value was specified for "wait on arrival"
389
Is anchor
390
If 'yes' is specified then:
If the anchor event (defined by the timing instructions) is "stabilization" or "circle" - the holding area must be reached at the anchor time.
If the anchor event is "direction exit" - the end of the entry corridor (the direction exit point) must be reached at the anchor time.
391
A command should not be defined as an anchor when an arrival time is specified. An anchor command is timed only according to the anchor time defined in the timing instructions.
392
1. Definitions:
- The "actual sector" is the specified sector or the sector implied by the specified "holding area" / "entry corridor".
- The "actual holding route" is the "holding area" - if specified, otherwise - the "preferred route" (atomic function) for waiting in the "actual sector" (may be empty).
- The "entry path" is the entry path (tactical function) to the center of the "actual sector" based on [the geometry of] the specified "actual entry corridor".
- The "actual wait on arrival" value (yes/no) is determined as defined in the description of the "wait on arrival" parameter.
- The "expected anchor event" is "stabilization" - if the "actual wait on arrival" value is 'yes', otherwise - "direction exit".
- The "actual arrival time" (may be empty) is determined as follows: if "is anchor" is specified - 'yes' - it is the formation's anchor time, otherwise it is the specified "arrival time".

5. If the formation is not inside the sector and also the "actual wait on arrival" value is 'no' (entry only) or (the "actual wait on arrival" value is 'yes' and also the "actual holding route" is empty) (entry and waiting):
- The "arrival path" is an operational air path from the current vector (tactical function) to the start point of the "entry path".
- The "shortened entry path" is the "entry path" without the part that passes inside [the polygon of] the "actual sector", except for the "excess entry range into the sector" from its beginning. Explanation: the point to be reached must be inside the sector and not on its perimeter.
- The "full path" is a conditional threat zone avoiding air path (tactical function) based on the concatenation of the "arrival path" and the "shortened entry path".
- Perform "scheduled flight along a path" on the "full path" with an "arrival time" equal to the "actual arrival time".

6. If "wet run" and also the "actual wait on arrival" value is 'yes' - perform "holding pattern in the air" on [the geometry of] the "actual holding route" (may be empty).
393
If "is anchor" is specified - 'yes': send anchor alerts
If the "actual wait on arrival" value is 'yes' and "actual holding route" is defined: fly to point
Otherwise if the formation is not already inside the sector: fly along a path

1. General definitions
- "Base path" is the reverse of the specified "path" - if "reverse path" is specified - 'yes', otherwise it is the specified "path".
- "Start point" is the start point of the "base path" - if "intercept path from its beginning" is specified - 'yes', otherwise it is the point on the "base path" closest to the current location of the formation.
- The "timing to the end of the path" value is 'yes' if the flight along a path command is scheduled to its end (tactical function).
- The "expected anchor event" is "direction exit" - if "timing to the end of the path", otherwise - "stabilization".
- The "actual arrival time" (may be empty) is the formation's anchor time - if "is anchor" is specified - 'yes', otherwise it is the specified "arrival time".

2. How to calculate the "actual path"
- The "raw path" is the final segment of the "base path", starting from the "start point".
- The "origin sector" (may be empty) is the containing sector (atomic function) of the "start point".
- The "sector boundaries" value is determined as follows: if the "origin sector" is not empty and the entire "raw path" is inside (atomic function) the "origin sector" polygon - it is the "origin sector" polygon, otherwise - an empty polygon.
- The "raw path avoiding threat zones" is an air path avoiding threat zones (tactical function) based on the "raw path" and the "sector boundaries".
- The "actual speed" is the specified "ground speed" - if specified, otherwise - the typical speed of the formation.
- The "turning radius" is the turning radius (nautical miles) (tactical function) of the formation at the "actual speed".
- The "actual path" is a rounded turns path (atomic function) based on the "raw path avoiding threat zones" and the "turning radius".

3. If "is anchor" is specified - 'yes' - perform sending of anchor alerts with "fly along a path" as "command name" and the "expected anchor event" as "expected anchor event 1".

The returned path may contain transit segments in a threat zone that cannot be bypassed, in particular (but not only) when the start/end point is inside a threat zone.
If the specified sector boundaries are empty - there is no restriction on the location of the bypass segments. Non-empty sector boundaries affect the choice of bypass segments as follows:
- If the suspect path is entirely within the sector boundaries - the bypass segments must also be within the sector boundaries.
- If the suspect path is not entirely within the sector boundaries - there is a preference for shortening the part of the bypass segments that passes outside the sector boundaries.
670

671
Conditional air path avoiding threat zones
672
An air path intended for the specified formation, based on the specified suspect path, where segments passing through a threat zone are replaced if possible by bypass segments, only if the specified "straight line" value is 'yes' or if the formation deviates from a sector to avoid a threat zone (as derived from the flight approval in a threat zone defined in the mission instructions). The returned path is rounded turns according to the specified turning radius (in nautical miles).

Explanation: If flying in a straight line - the specified "suspect path" is a straight line on which no threat zone avoidance logic has been applied at all, and therefore it must be applied here. Otherwise - the threat zone avoidance logic has already been applied separately to each of the three segments of the "suspect path" (exit from sector, linking, entry to sector), so that the "suspect path" does not violate the rules of entry and exit from sectors through entry/exit routes. In this case, an additional activation of the threat zone avoidance logic here - without reference to sectors, may cause a violation of the rules (entry/exit not through entry/exit routes) and therefore it is conditional on the policy dictated by the mission instructions.

A path is considered to cross threat zones if it passes through at least one threat zone relevant to the formation's "applicable operation ID".
Does the specified air path pass through at least one threat zone relevant to the "applicable operation ID" of the specified formation.
754
A base object located within a range of 500 meters from the specified coordinate.
If there is no such object - an empty object value is returned.
755
The ID of a landing strip linked to the specified operation and located within a range of 500 meters from the specified coordinate.
If there is no such one - an empty value is returned.

Actual landing location
758
The actual landing location of the specified formation is determined as follows:
- If "landing coordinate" is specified - the "landing point" is this coordinate.
- Otherwise if "landing strip" is specified - the "landing point" is this coordinate.
- Otherwise if "landing base" is specified - the "landing point" is at the location of the specified "landing base".
- Otherwise - the implied "landing point" is the "first takeoff point" (as stored in memory by a scheduled flight along a path command).
759
The closest usable airbase to the formation
760
The closest airbase to the specified formation that meets all the following conditions:
- Its maximum runway length is not shorter than the required runway length (tactical function) by the formation.
- It has the same military affiliation as the formation.
- It is at a distance not exceeding the specified maximum range from the current location of the formation.
761
Maximum range (nautical miles)
762
Nearby usable takeoff/landing base
763
A usable airbase within a range of up to 1/2 mile from the formation's location. If there is no such one - an empty value is returned.
764
Nearby takeoff/landing landing strip ID
765
The ID of the landing strip near the formation.
If no nearby landing strip linked to the applicable operation for the formation is found - an empty value is returned.
766
Retrieve the "send takeoff report (C2)" value from the permanent memory of the specified formation.
767
Base usable by a formation
768
The specified base is considered usable (takeoff/landing) by the specified air unit if its maximum runway length is not shorter than the required runway length (tactical function) by the formation.
