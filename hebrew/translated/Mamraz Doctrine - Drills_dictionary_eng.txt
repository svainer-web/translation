Implementation principles:

1. Do not open fire on targets at a range that exceeds 2/3 of the effective firing range (assuming it is difficult to be accurate when firing at distant targets while moving).

2. The list of potential targets includes only enemy units at a recognition level of "recognition" at least.

3. The potential targets are prioritized for firing as follows:
+ All targets of the maneuvering/assaulting type are prioritized over all targets that are not of the maneuvering/assaulting type
+ The targets of each group are prioritized among themselves according to proximity.

4. If direct fire is absorbed that caused casualties or if the firer is of the armor/anti-tank type (even if the fire did not cause casualties) - return fire on the firer with the highest priority (even if the firer is at a range greater than 2/3 of the effective range). The firer is in any case entered into the detection list, so that even if he is not fired upon with the highest priority, the other rules still apply to him.

5. In any case, do not fire on more than 4 targets simultaneously.

The jump is intended to allow movement for a vehicle-based weapon systems group that is required to move on a nearby road but is "trapped" in impassable terrain without being able to reach the road by movement.

A 'yes' value is returned if the weapon systems group is a mobile surface-to-surface launcher (*** bypass) or if all the following conditions are met:
- The unit is vehicle-based.
- The distance between the target point and the starting point does not exceed 100 m.

578
The existence of available space for transporting soldiers in busy leading units intentionally "delays" the end of the command.
This is because in the case of a split of a leading unit (in the process of "mounting the vehicles" of the infantry unit on it), a temporary situation may arise in which there is a leading unit with available space but it is still busy because it has not yet had time to finish executing the "collect infantry unit" command.
