1. The breach direction is the direction of the "breach line".

2. The search area for the two cover positions (close cover and distant cover) is a sector of a zone, between the "minimum range for cover search" and the "maximum range for cover search". The azimuth of the center of the zone is the back azimuth of the "breach direction".

3. The close cover position is searched for with the aim of controlling the "close control area at the obstacle", a circular area centered on the breach point.

4. The distant cover position is searched for with the aim of controlling the "enemy position ellipse", within the range limitation of the distant cover force's weapon system.
- The "enemy position ellipse" is an ellipse facing the specified breach point and centered on the "enemy position" point.
- The "enemy position" is in the "distant control area at the obstacle": a sector of a zone between the "minimum range for distant control at the obstacle" and the "maximum range for distant control at theobstacle". The azimuth of the center of the zone is the azimuth of the "breach direction".
- The "enemy position" is at the location of the closest combat enemy detection to the breach point from among all the enemy detections in the "distant control area at the obstacle". If there is no such enemy detection - an optimal "estimated enemy position" is searched for to control the "close control area at the obstacle". If one is not found - an "estimated enemy position" is arbitrarily assumed at the center of the "distant control area at the obstacle".
- If no accessible distant cover position is found within the search area - the distant cover force is positioned at the close cover position.

5. The bridgehead position is searched for
- in a corridor around a section of the continuation of the advance route, which ends at a maximum of "maximum offset for the end of the bridgehead search corridor" from the breach point (along the route) and starts at the "start offset of the bridgehead search corridor" from it. If the continuation of the advance route is too short - it is artificially extended based on the smoothed azimuth at the end of the route, in order to ensure that the length of the search corridor will be at least the "minimum length for the bridgehead search corridor".
- relative to the controlled area ellipse based on the "default for controlled area from a position" relative to the breach point and the breach direction.

1. In open terrain: deploy along a route leading to a cover point, which is searched for in a sector (see diagram) whose central axis is the azimuth from the center of the specified threat area to the unit's location.
In a closed area: dismount from vehicles, i.e., all foot-mobile elementary units dismount from the vehicles.

2. All elementary units take up positions at their locations towards the center of the threat area.
311

338
1. The entered attack route must be extended (if necessary), up to the center of the key area, on a best-effort basis - a route to the closest point that can be reached by mounted movement according to the unit's vehicle passability constraints.

2. In phase A, move in a mounted column on the extended attack route, up to the dismounting point, which is at the end of the route or before it - as required so as not to get closer than the "foot movement range" from the center of the key area.

369
1. The type of assault - mounted or on foot is determined by the composition of the force: if the force is entirely on foot - the assault is on foot, otherwise - mounted.

2. The actual assault range is the distance from the unit's location to the target - the center of the cluster area. If it exceeds the maximum assault range, as derived from the type of assault - the assault is not performed.

3. The search for the assault route to the target is limited to a corridor whose width as a percentage of the actual assault range is given by the "percentage of the width of the search corridor".

4. The final gap is the distance between the end point of the found assault route and the target. The maximum tolerable final gap is also derived from the type of assault. If the final gap exceeds the tolerable final gap - the assault is not performed.

5. The assault is performed by moving in a line formation along the assault route, without stopping.

If the target is within assault range and an assault route is found that reaches close enough to the target - move without stopping, in a line formation on the assault route.
