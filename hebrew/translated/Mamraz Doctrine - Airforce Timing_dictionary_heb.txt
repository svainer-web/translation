1. Initialize the offset of each of the execution states to the offset of the preceding state plus its stay duration and save it in the permanent memory of the formation. Each stay duration is randomized within the range between its corresponding minimum and maximum values.
(The start offset of the "waiting for takeoff" state is equal to its stay duration)

2. Initialize the actual offset to the start offset of the "briefing" state (the sum of all the stay durations determined above) plus one second (to ensure that the "current state" will be "before briefing") and save it in the permanent memory of the formation.

Waiting for first takeoff (implementation)
50
Waiting on the ground until the planned time for the first takeoff arrives, while updating the flight plan execution status to reflect the preparation stages for the flight.
The wait takes into account the alert level and scramble time constraints - if defined.
Prior to takeoff, verification is performed on the ground for the planned designated points for attack.

1. Definitions:
- "Actual offset" (of type time duration) is the time required to complete the preparations (passing through the various execution states) until takeoff. This property represents the current readiness state of the formation and is stored in the permanent memory (and not in the memory of this command) so that it is not lost in case of a repeated flight plan generation.
- "First takeoff capability time" is the earliest time at which it is possible to take off, considering the required preparation constraints. It is equal to the current time plus the "actual offset".
- "Current state" (of type mission execution state (pre-execution)) is derived from the "actual offset" and the randomized stay duration for each of the execution states.
- "Desired offset" is the difference between the "determining readiness time" and the current time.
- "Desired-actual offset gap" is equal to "desired offset from first takeoff" minus "actual offset".
- "Ground target verification offset" is randomly drawn between a "minimum offset" and a "maximum".
- "Desirable to wait on the runway" when the "current state" is "taxiing" or "waiting for takeoff" and the remaining time until takeoff (the difference between "planned first takeoff time" and the current time) does not exceed the "maximum wait time on the runway".


2. In the first calculation cycle only:
a. Set the "TB link available" value in the permanent memory of the formation according to a draw based on the "probability of TB link availability in the bunker".
b. If the "allow takeoff before preparation is complete" value of the formation is 'no' and
          "first takeoff capability time" is later than the "planned first takeoff time" (doctrinal function) of the formation
          by an amount exceeding the "takeoff delay tolerance" value (doctrinal constant) then
          - Send the formation a warning message specifying the expected delay in takeoff and the actual expected takeoff time (the command's end time)

3. In every calculation cycle starting from the second:
a.
- The "flow direction" (progress/regression) is determined by the sign of the "desired-actual offset gap": a negative gap describes a state of delay - which requires progress (decreasing the "actual offset"), a positive gap describes a state of excessive advance - which requires regression (increasing the "actual offset").
- The "rate of change" is equal to the time elapsed since the previous calculation cycle multiplied by the "rate multiplier" (see "pre-execution" states table) characteristic of the "current state" and the "flow direction".
- If the "flow direction" is regression and "it is desirable to wait on the runway", or if the "desired-actual offset gap is zero - finish the iteration execution.
- If the "flow direction" is progress and the "remaining delay" value in the permanent memory of the formation is not empty and greater than zero
then decrease the "remaining delay" by the "rate of change" in order to "waste" delay time instead of progressing.
Otherwise if the "current state" is "waiting for takeoff" update the "actual offset" in the formation memory to the "start offset" of "waiting on takeoff" plus one second (in order to change the state to "taxiing")
Otherwise update the "actual offset" in the formation memory by the "rate of change" according to the "flow direction" (in progress it is decreased, in regression it is increased).

b. Execute a "set mission execution status" command to update:
- The "mission execution status" of the formation to the execution status according to the updated "actual offset".
- The "execution status note" of the formation so that it reflects the available communication channel for the mission according to the "mission execution status" (see "pre-execution" states table) and the "TB link available" value from the permanent memory of the formation.

c. If the "required alert level" value (from the formation's memory) is not empty then (checking "ready")
If the "actual offset" is not greater than the "alert response time" (doctrinal function) corresponding to the "required alert level" and ("flow direction" is "progress" or "ready report can be sent" (doctrinal function)) then
- Perform "set timing instructions" to update "existing alert level" to "required alert level".
- Send a "ready" report to the C2 system.
- Send a message to the formation: "A 'ready' report was sent at [display name of "required alert level"] alert".
- Delete the "required alert level" value in the formation's memory.

d. If the "perform ground verification" value in the mission instructions of the built-in is "yes", and a "cluster of designated points for verification" was also specified:
If the "flow direction" is forward and ground verification has not yet been performed (memory note) and the "actual offset" is not greater than the "ground verification execution offset" then
- Perform "ground target verification"
- Remember that ground verification was performed.

e. If the "flow direction" is backward then
- "Forget" that ground verification was performed (if it was performed), so that verification will be performed again when the flow resumes forward.
- Delete the "remaining delay" and "original delay" in the permanent memory of the formation (delay is not relevant in regression).

1. If the "actual offset" value stored in the formation's memory is empty - execute the "initialize first takeoff wait offsets" command.
Explanation: a non-empty value means that a previous execution of "waiting for first takeoff" was temporarily suspended, stopped, or completed. In such a case, the existing offset values must be preserved for continuity.

2. If a "planned first takeoff time" was specified - execute the "set planned first takeoff time" command to update the formation's "planned first takeoff time".

3. If the takeoff location is closed (the end time of the takeoff/landing location closure is not empty and has not yet passed) - execute "handle takeoff base/airfield closure".

4. Execute "waiting for first takeoff (implementation)".

5. Execute "set mission execution status" with an "execution status note" value of an empty string.

6. If the "formation ready for first takeoff" value (doctrinal function) of the formation is 'no'
          then execute "report takeoff before preparation is complete".

314
Cannot change alert level because the formation has no existing alert level defined.
315
Delay in meeting alert level
316
Duration of delay in confirming the new alert level as a result of not meeting the existing alert level.

2. If a "delay in meeting alert level" value was specified - save it in the permanent memory of the formation under "remaining delay" (the value gradually decreased by the "waiting for first takeoff" command) and under "original delay" - for later reporting.
319
A delay in meeting the alert level was specified
320
The required alert level has a defined response time

Existing alert level
335
Alert is a state in which the executing formation is required to wait on the ground for a scramble command, which may advance the planned takeoff time.
The existing alert level determines the response time that the formation is required to meet - between receiving the scramble command and the actual takeoff.
336
The formation has no defined alert start time. In order to set an existing alert level, the alert start time must also be specified.
337
Alert start time
338
The existing alert is valid only from this time.
339
An alert start time cannot be specified if an existing alert level has not been specified or defined in the mission instructions.
340
The time at which the scramble command was received for the formation on alert.
341
A scramble time can only be defined for a formation that is on alert.
342
The planned time for the first takeoff of the formation as part of the mission.
343
Cannot set timing instructions for a formation that has already taken off.
344
Allow takeoff before preparation is complete
345
A 'yes' value means that the "waiting for first takeoff" command will end at the planned first takeoff time in any case, even if the formation's preparation process on the ground is not complete.
346
The time at which the mission's anchor event is required to occur.
347
The formation has no defined anchor event. In order to set an anchor time, the anchor event must also be specified.
348
Anchor event
349
The type of the main event of the mission - according to which the entire mission is timed.
350
The formation has no defined anchor time. In order to set an anchor event, the anchor time must also be specified.
351
Anchor event location
352
The expected location of the formation when the anchor event occurs.
During the execution of the flight plan, a continuous assessment of the ability to reach this location at the anchor time is performed, and an alert is issued if a delay is expected.
353
The formation has no defined anchor time. In order to set an anchor event location, the anchor time must also be specified.
354
0. If an existing alert level was specified and it has no defined response time - stop activity with the message "The specified alert level has no required response time defined in the system's parameter database. Please contact the system administrator.".

1. Execute the "set timing instructions (atomic)" command with the specified parameters, except for "scramble time" and "first takeoff time".

2. If a "allow takeoff before preparation is complete" value was specified - execute the "set allow takeoff before preparation is complete" command with the corresponding boolean value.

3. If "scramble time" was specified - execute the "scramble" command.
Note: Executing the "scramble" command causes a scramble at the current time and not at the specified "scramble time" (which probably came from the C2 system), and therefore the formation is expected to take off late.

4. If "scramble time" was specified and/or "first takeoff time" was specified - execute the "set timing instructions (atomic)" command with the specified "scramble time" and "first takeoff time" parameters.

5. Send a report message to the formation: "[parameter name] was set to [parameter value]..." for each specified (non-empty) parameter. Parameters should be attached to a joint message according to the following groups:
- "Existing alert level" with "alert start time" and "scramble time"
- "Planned first takeoff time" with "allow takeoff before preparation is complete"
- "Anchor time" with "anchor event" and "anchor event location".

Note: This command is intentionally designed to serve as an "administrative command" that allows "bending" the constraints of reality. Therefore, it does not restrict the user on the one hand, but on the other hand, it also does not guarantee that the operational result obtained from its use will be "realistic".
355
"Existing alert level" was not specified or the entered "existing alert level" has a defined response time
356
"Scramble time" was specified
357

An alert is sent to formations executing "flight to landing" and are expected to land at the base/airfield when it is closed.
362
The nearby base/airfield will be closed until this time.
363
Do not specify a time in the past.
364
Closure duration
365
