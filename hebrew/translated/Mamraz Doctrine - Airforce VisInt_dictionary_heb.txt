Track target (implementation)
2
Tracking a target that may be in motion, while adjusting the flight path to the target's movement as needed.
The tracking is performed by circling a "UAV base path for circling" as stored in the formation's memory, at the "observation circling radius" as stored in the formation's memory.

- Loss/re-acquisition of target detection.
- Exiting coverage/returning to coverage of the target from the circling path - in case the tracking is forced to a specified observation flight path ("track from path only").
- Leaving the specified observation flight path in order to keep the target in coverage.

0. Definitions
- The target is considered to be in motion if it is a "live" detection that is in motion or if its current detection location is not empty and is different from its last detection location.
- The UAV's base path for circling should be changed if all the following conditions are met:
    + The target is not in full coverage [from the current base path for circling].
    + The specified "track from path only" value is 'no'
    + The target appears to be in motion

1. If the UAV's base path for circling should be changed then
- Set the memory note "UAV base path for circling" to "base path for circling a N.P. for a UAV" (doctrinal function) for "the known location of the target"
- Send a "UAV base path for circling changed" event.

2.
- Set the memory note "UAV tracked target detection status" to the target's detection status according to the operator's detection list.
- Set the memory note "last detection location of UAV target" to the target unit's detection location according to the operator's detection list.
- Set the memory note "UAV tracked target is in full coverage" to the value "target is in full coverage".

3.
- If the "last detection status of the target" from the executing formation's memory is "live detection" and the "current detection status of the target" from the formation's memory is not "live detection" (the target was lost):
  Send an information message of type "tracked target lost": "The target cannot be detected. Continuing to observe the location where it was last seen."
- If the "last detection status of the target" is not "live detection" and the "current detection status of the target" is "live detection" (the target was re-acquired):
  Send an information message of type "tracked target re-acquired": "The target has been re-acquired. Continuing to track."

4. Leaving the observation flight path (specified in the "track target" command) occurs if all the following conditions are met:
- An observation flight path was specified
- Track from path only was specified - 'no'
- The target is not in full coverage
- The base path for circling is the specified observation flight path.
If leaving the observation flight path occurs:
Send an information message of type "UAV leaving observation flight path": "The target has moved. Leaving the defined observation flight path in order not to lose it."
Change the value of "observation circling radius" in the formation's memory to "typical UAV circling radius in observation" (doctrinal function).

5. If the specified "track from path only" value is 'yes':
- If the value of "UAV tracked target is in full coverage" in the formation's memory is 'yes' and "the target is in full coverage" is 'no' (the target has left full coverage):
Send an information message of type "tracked target left full coverage": "The target has moved so that it is no longer in full coverage from the defined observation flight path. Continuing to track from the path, despite the coverage limitations."
- If the value of "UAV tracked target is in full coverage" in the formation's memory is 'no' and "the target is in full coverage" (the target has returned to full coverage):
Send an information message of type "tracked target returned to full coverage": "The target has moved back into full coverage from the defined observation flight path."
24
The target cannot be detected. Continuing to observe the location where it was last seen.
25
The target has been re-acquired. Continuing to track.
