54
Dry substitute.
55
Path
56
The path along which to fly.
57
Initial speed
58
The initial speed (relative to the ground) at which the flight begins - in knots. If not specified - the flight begins at the current speed.
59
Initial altitude
60
The absolute altitude (above sea level) at which the flight begins - in thousands of feet. If not specified - the flight begins at the current altitude.
61
Landing at the end
62
Whether to land (i.e., descend to ground level) at the end point of the specified path.
63
The whole unit
64
In case there is no landing at the end, the flight termination altitude is arbitrarily set to the desired flight altitude.
65
Set flight characteristics (atomic) (dry)
66
Dry substitute.
67
Altitude
68
The desired absolute flight altitude (above sea level) in thousands of feet. If no value is specified - the desired flight altitude remains unchanged.
69
Speed
70
The desired flight speed relative to the ground - in knots. If not specified - the desired flight speed remains unchanged.

Dry substitute.
89
Existing alert status
90
Alert status is a state in which the executing formation is required to wait on the ground for a scramble command, which may precede the planned takeoff time. The existing alert level determines the response time that the formation is required to meet - between receiving the scramble command and the actual takeoff.
91
Alert start time
92
The existing alert status is valid only from this time.
93
Scramble time
94
The time at which the scramble command was received for the formation on alert.
95
Planned first takeoff time
96
The planned time for the formation's first takeoff as part of the mission.
97
Anchor time
98
The time at which the mission's anchor event is required to occur.
99
Anchor event
100
The type of the main event of the mission - according to which the entire mission is scheduled.
101
Anchor event location
102
The expected location of the formation when the anchor event occurs. During the execution of the flight plan, a continuous assessment of the ability to reach this location at the anchor time is performed, and an alert is generated if a delay is expected.
103
Last takeoff time
104
The time of the last takeoff performed by the formation.
105
Required alert status
106
The alert status to which the formation is required to transition in the event of an alert status change. The completion of the transition is reflected in the setting of the value of the existing alert status to the required alert status.

110
Waiting duration
111
If the waiting duration is not specified - the command will terminate immediately.
112
