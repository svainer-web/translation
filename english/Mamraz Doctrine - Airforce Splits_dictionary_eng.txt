1. Perform "Split Munitions Group" with "number of leavers" equal to the specified "number of splitters", for the purpose of "birthing" a new formation. For the avoidance of doubt: the new formation is not linked to an OP.

2. Send a "Post-Split Execution Order" event to the new formation.

- L is the "Leader Number" (utility function)
- N is the number of remaining aircraft (the initial number of aircraft minus the number of splitters, in the example: 2).

4. Perform "Send Message" (self) of type "Warning without handling": "[Number of splitters] aircraft have split from [Original formation name]".

 - "Initial Altitude" equal to the current altitude of the original formation.

7. If there is a need to fly to a target in the air (a "target in the air" grid coordinate was specified and there is no need to perform self-destruction) - perform "Arrival at Grid Coordinate" with:
- Grid coordinate - the specified "target in the air" grid coordinate
- Arrival time - empty
- Wait on arrival - 'no'
- Straight line to grid coordinate - the specified "straight line to target".

8. If self-destruction is to be performed - perform "Bailout (Implementation)" with the specified "target in the air" grid coordinate and "straight line to target" values.

- Straight line to landing - the specified "straight line to target"
- Landing base - the actual landing base (the specified landing base or the base closest to the formation - if "land at a nearby base" was specified).
- Landing airstrip - as specified
- Landing grid coordinate - as specified.
