"First Takeoff Capability Time" is the earliest time at which takeoff can be performed, considering the required preparation constraints, and is equal to the current time plus the "Actual Offset".
58
1. Initialize the offset of each of the execution states to the offset of its preceding state plus its stay duration, and save it in the permanent memory of the formation. Each stay duration is randomly drawn in the range between its corresponding minimum and maximum values.
(The start offset of the "Wait for Takeoff" state is equal to its stay duration)

2. Initialize the actual offset to the start offset of the "Briefing" state (the sum of all the stay durations determined above) plus one second (to ensure the "Current State" will be "Before Briefing") and save it in the permanent memory of the formation.

Wait for First Takeoff (Implementation)
72
Waiting on the ground until the planned time for the first takeoff arrives, while updating the flight plan execution status to reflect the flight preparation stages.
The wait considers the readiness level and scramble time constraints - if defined.
Prior to takeoff, on-ground verification of the designated points planned for attack is performed.
73
Designated Point Cluster for Verification
74
1. Definitions:
- "Actual Offset" (of type time duration) is the time required to complete the preparations (passing through the various execution states) until takeoff. This property represents the current readiness state of the formation and is saved in the permanent memory (and not in the memory of this command) so that it is not lost in case of a repeated flight plan generation.
- "First Takeoff Capability Time" is the earliest time at which takeoff can be performed, considering the required preparation constraints. It is equal to the current time plus the "Actual Offset".
- "Current State" (of type pre-execution mission state) is derived from the "Actual Offset" and the stay duration drawn for each of the execution states.
- "Desired Offset" is the difference between the "Determining Readiness Time" and the current time.
- "Desired-Actual Offset Gap" is equal to "Desired Offset from First Takeoff" minus "Actual Offset".
- "On-Ground Target Verification Offset" is randomly drawn between "Minimum Offset" and "Maximum".
- "Desirable to Wait on Runway" when the "Current State" is "Taxiing" or "Wait for Takeoff" and the remaining time until takeoff (the difference between "Planned Time for First Takeoff" and the current time) does not exceed the "Maximum Duration for Waiting on Runway".

2. In the first calculation cycle only:
a. Set the "TB Link Available" value in the permanent memory of the formation according to a draw based on the "Probability of TB Link Availability in the Shelter".
b. If the "Allow Takeoff Before Preparation Completion" value of the formation is 'no' and also
          "First Takeoff Capability Time" is later than the "Planned Time for First Takeoff" (utility function) of the formation
          by a rate exceeding the "Tolerance for Late Takeoff" value (utility constant) then
          - Send the formation a warning message specifying the expected delay in takeoff and the actual expected takeoff time (the command's end time).

3. In each calculation cycle starting from the second:
a.
- "Flow Direction" (progress/regression) is determined by the sign of the "Desired-Actual Offset Gap": a negative gap describes a state of delay - which requires progress (decreasing the "Actual Offset"), a positive gap describes a state of excessive advance - which requires regression (increasing the "Actual Offset").
- "Rate of Change" is equal to the time elapsed since the previous calculation cycle multiplied by the "Rate Multiplier" (see "Pre-Execution" states table) typical of the "Current State" and the "Flow Direction".
- If the "Flow Direction" is regression and it is "Desirable to Wait on Runway", or if the "Desired-Actual Offset Gap" is zero - end the iteration execution.
- If the "Flow Direction" is progress and the "Remaining Delay" value in the permanent memory of the formation is not empty and is greater than zero
then subtract the "Remaining Delay" by the "Rate of Change" in order to "waste" delay time instead of progressing.
Otherwise if the "Current State" is "Wait for Takeoff", update the "Actual Offset" in the formation's memory to the "Start Offset" of "Wait for Takeoff" plus one second (in order to change the state to "Taxiing")
Otherwise update the "Actual Offset" in the formation's memory by the "Rate of Change" according to the "Flow Direction" (in progress, subtract; in regression, add).

b. Perform the "Set Mission Execution Status" command to update:
- The "Mission Execution Status" of the formation to the execution state according to the updated "Actual Offset".
- The "Note for Mission Execution Status" of the formation so that it reflects the available communication channel for the mission according to the "Mission Execution Status" (see "Pre-Execution" states table) and the "TB Link Available" value from the permanent memory of the formation.

c. If the "Required Readiness" value (from the formation's memory) is not empty then (check "Ready")
If the "Actual Offset" is not greater than the "Response Time for Readiness" (utility function) corresponding to the "Required Readiness" and ("Flow Direction" is "Progress" or "Ready Report Can Be Sent" (utility function)) then
- Perform "Set Timing Instructions" to update "Existing Readiness" to "Required Readiness".
- Send a "Ready" report to the C2 system.
- Send a message to the formation: "A 'Ready' report has been sent at readiness level [Display name of "Required Readiness"]".
- Delete the "Required Readiness" value in the formation's memory.

d. If the "Perform On-Ground Verification" value in the mission instructions of the formation is "yes", and a "Designated Point Cluster for Verification" was also specified:
If the "Flow Direction" is forward and on-ground verification has not yet been performed (memory note) and the "Actual Offset" is not greater than the "On-Ground Verification Execution Offset" then
- Perform "On-Ground Target Verification"
- Remember that on-ground verification was performed.

e. If the "Flow Direction" is backward then
- "Forget" that on-ground verification was performed (if it was), so that verification will be performed again when the flow resumes forward.
- Delete the "Remaining Delay" and "Original Delay" in the permanent memory of the formation (delay is not relevant in regression).

- "Target Time for First Takeoff" is equal to the "Determining Readiness Time" plus/minus the specified "Delay/Advancement in Takeoff" value.
- "Takeoff Location Closure End Time" is the end time of the takeoff/landing location closure (utility function) applicable to the current location.

2. If the "Takeoff Location Closure End Time" is not empty and the "Target Time for First Takeoff" is earlier than it - send a corresponding message to the formation and terminate with failure.

3. Remember the "Planned Time for First Takeoff Before Scramble", for "Cancel Scramble" - if and when it occurs.

4. Activate "Set Timing Instructions (atomic)" to change:
-  "Scramble Time" to the current time.
-  "Planned Time for First Takeoff" to the "Target Time for First Takeoff".

337
Cancel Scramble
338
Cancel a scramble for a formation that is on readiness, which has already been scrambled but has not yet taken off.
339
1. If the "Scramble Time" in the timing instructions is empty - send a warning message to the unit "Cancel scramble was not performed as the formation was not scrambled at all.".

2. If the formation is not waiting for the first takeoff (utility function) - send a warning message to the unit "Cancel scramble was not performed as the formation is not performing wait for first takeoff".

3. Activate "Set Timing Instructions (atomic)" to change:
-  "Scramble Time" to an empty value.
-  "Planned Time for First Takeoff" to the "Planned Time for First Takeoff Before Scramble" - as saved in the formation's memory by the scramble command.

Change the existing readiness of the formation to the required readiness.
After reaching the required readiness level, a "Ready at Readiness" report is sent to the C2 system.
350
Required Readiness
351
Readiness cannot be changed because the formation has no existing readiness defined.
352
Delay in Meeting Readiness
353
Duration of delay in approving the new readiness as a result of not meeting the existing readiness.
If the formation has no existing readiness defined and no delay in approving readiness was specified - the approval of the new readiness will be performed immediately.

362
Set Timing Instructions - [Existing readiness to "Existing readiness"] [Readiness start time to "Readiness start time"]
[Scramble time to "Scramble time"]
[Planned time for first takeoff to "Planned time for first takeoff"]
[Allow takeoff before preparation completion to "Allow takeoff before preparation completion"]
[Anchor time to "Anchor time"]
[Anchor event to "Anchor event"]
[Anchor event location to "Anchor event location"]
363
Only components for which a value was specified appear.
364
Existing Readiness
365
Readiness is a state in which the executing formation is required to wait on the ground to receive a scramble command, which may advance the planned takeoff time.
The existing readiness level determines the response time that the formation is required to meet - between receiving the scramble command and the actual takeoff.
366
The formation has no defined readiness start time. To set an existing readiness, the readiness start time must also be specified.
367
Readiness Start Time
368
The existing readiness is valid only from this time.
369
A readiness start time cannot be specified if no existing readiness was specified or defined in the mission instructions.
370
Scramble Time
371
The time at which the scramble command was received for the formation on readiness.
372
A scramble time can only be defined for a formation that is on readiness.
373
Planned Time for First Takeoff
374
The planned time for the first takeoff of the formation as part of the mission.
375
Setting timing instructions cannot be performed for a formation that has already taken off.
376
Allow Takeoff Before Preparation Completion
377
A 'yes' value means that the "Wait for First Takeoff" command will end at the planned time for the first takeoff in any case, even if the formation's on-ground preparation process has not been completed.
378
Anchor Time
379
The time at which the mission's anchor event is required to occur.
380
The formation has no defined anchor event. To set an anchor time, the anchor event must also be specified.
381
Anchor Event
382
The type of the main event of the mission - according to which the entire mission is timed.
383
The formation has no defined anchor time. To set an anchor event, the anchor time must also be specified.
384
Anchor Event Location
385
The expected location of the formation when the anchor event occurs.
During the execution of the flight plan, a continuous assessment of the ability to reach this location at the anchor time is performed, and an alert is generated if a delay is expected.
386
The formation has no defined anchor time. To set an anchor event location, the anchor time must also be specified.
387
0. If an existing readiness was specified and it has no defined response time - stop activity with the message "The specified readiness has no required response time defined in the system's parameter database. Please contact the system administrator.".

1. Perform the "Set Timing Instructions (atomic)" command with the specified parameters, except for "Scramble Time" and "First Takeoff Time".

2. If an "Allow Takeoff Before Preparation Completion" value was specified - perform the "Set Allow Takeoff Before Preparation Completion" command with the corresponding boolean value.

3. If "Scramble Time" was specified - perform the "Scramble" command.
Note: Executing the "Scramble" command causes a scramble at the current time and not at the specified "Scramble Time" (which likely came from the C2 system), and therefore the formation is expected to take off late.

4. If "Scramble Time" was specified and/or "Planned Time for First Takeoff" was specified - perform the "Set Timing Instructions (atomic)" command with the specified "Scramble Time" and "Planned Time for First Takeoff" parameters.

5. Send a report message to the formation: "[Parameter Name] was set to [Parameter Value]..." for each specified (non-empty) parameter. Parameters should be attached to a common message according to the following groups:
- "Existing Readiness" with "Readiness Start Time" and "Scramble Time"
- "Planned Time for First Takeoff" with "Allow Takeoff Before Preparation Completion"
- "Anchor Time" with "Anchor Event" and "Anchor Event Location".

Note: This command is intentionally designed to serve as an "administrative command" that allows "bending" the constraints of reality. Therefore, it does not restrict the user on the one hand, but on the other hand, it also does not guarantee that the operational result obtained from its use will be "realistic".
