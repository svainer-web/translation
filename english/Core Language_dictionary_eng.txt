Dry Run
621
Returns 'true' during Dry Running (both planning and execution).
Note: "Dry Running" a Doctrinal Command/GNT is a process of executing it without consuming time and without influencing the simulated world, i.e without issuing any Atomic Command that may change it.
"Dry Running" is the equivalent of "imagining" execution for the purpose of gaining insight into the expected outcome - in the form of generated Overlay Elements an/or remembered Memory Notes.
622
Dry Run Memory ID
623
Returns a nonexistent Job ID that is used as a ForJob value for Remember-ing and Recall-ing "Dry Permanent" Memory Notes, that are effectively permanent (retained between Jobs) throughout a single Dry Run but forgotten after it is finished (as they no longer serve any purpose).
