1. Time-stretching using a complete orbit is always performed at the current flight speed.

2. Performing a complete orbit allows for a continuous and finite range of time-stretching, as follows:

a. The minimum time-stretching is achieved by a circular orbit at the current speed.

b. The maximum time-stretching is achieved by a hippodrome orbit ("popsicle stick") at the minimum practical speed (a utility function), with a straight leg of "maximum straight leg length".

c. The continuous range between (a) and (b) is achieved by extending the straight leg of the hippodrome orbit up to the "maximum straight leg length".

3. The actual time-stretching is determined as follows: if the required time-stretching is greater than the maximum time-stretching - it is the maximum time-stretching, otherwise it is the required time-stretching.

2. "Remaining required time-stretching" is equal to the time difference between the "target time for ending time-stretching" and the current time.

3. If "minimum time-stretching in an orbit" (utility function) is not greater than "remaining required time-stretching" (need to stretch time): perform a single orbit for time-stretching with "remaining required time-stretching".

1. General definitions
- The "actual speed" is the specified "ground speed" - if specified, otherwise - the typical flight speed (utility function) for the formation.
- The "actual flight pattern" is the specified "flight pattern" - if specified, otherwise if the formation is on the ground (utility function) - "takeoff", otherwise - "cruise".
- The formation is considered to have "not yet performed first takeoff" if the value of formation performed first takeoff (utility function) for it is 'no'.
- The value of "takeoff required" is 'yes' if the formation is on the ground (utility function).
- The "base path" is the "flight path for threat zone monitoring" if there is a new threat zone on the flight path, otherwise it is the specified path.

2. How to calculate the "actual path"
- The "target point for interception" is the closest point to the formation on the specified "path".
- "Direct interception possible" if the formation is allowed to intercept a path directly (utility function) based on the "target point for interception".
- The "turning radius" is the turning radius (nautical mile) (utility function) of the formation at the "actual speed".
- The "direct interception path" is a conditional interception path (utility function) from the current location and current direction of the formation to the specified "path", based on the "turning radius".
- The "indirect interception path" is an operational air path from the current vector (utility function) of the formation to the "target point for interception", with a "landing" value of 'no', "straight line" - 'no', "speed" - the "actual speed".
- The "interception path" is the "direct interception path" - if "direct interception possible", otherwise it is the "indirect interception path".
- The "interception point" is the last point of the "interception path".
- The "destination path" is the final segment of the specified "path", starting from the "interception point".
- The "path without threat zone avoidance" is determined as follows:
If "takeoff required" and the current location of the formation is equal to the starting point of the specified "path" - it is the specified "path",
otherwise - it is a glued air path (utility function) from the "interception path" and the "destination path" based on the "turning radius".
- The "path including threat zone avoidance" is based on threat zone avoidance for an existing path (utility function) on the "path without threat zone avoidance".
- The "actual path" is determined as follows:
If "there is a new threat zone on the flight path" (indication in the permanent memory that was turned on by the mission/unit response rule "response to a new threat zone on a monitored flight path") - it is the "path including threat zone avoidance", otherwise it is the "path without threat zone avoidance".

3. If "takeoff required", perform:

a. If the executed OP value (atomic function) of the formation is not empty and (the formation "has not yet performed first takeoff" or the value of the permanent memory note "send takeoff report (C2)" is 'yes') - send a takeoff report to the C2 system and set the value of the permanent memory note "send takeoff report (C2)" to 'no'.
Explanation: The permanent memory note "send takeoff report (C2)" is shared by this command and the "flight to landing" command. The mechanism is designed to prevent sending takeoff reports to the C2 system following "occasional" landings and takeoffs - that were not planned in advance in the C2 system.

b. If the value of the permanent memory note "first takeoff point" is empty - set it to the current location with the name of the nearby base - if there is one.

c. Set the value of the permanent memory note "last takeoff time" to the current time value, for use by the "flight pattern check" response rule.

4. If "there is a new threat zone on the flight path" and the "path including threat zone avoidance" is different from the "path without threat zone avoidance" - send a warning message to the formation. If the path has been significantly lengthened as a result of avoiding the threat zones - the message requires handling.

5. Perform "set flight characteristics" (utility) to set the (desired) speed to the "actual speed" and the "flight pattern" to the "actual flight pattern".

6. Set the "new threat zone on flight path" indication in the formation's permanent memory to 'no'.

7. Perform "update flight path for threat zone monitoring" to the "actual path".

8. Perform "flight along a path (atomic)" on the "actual path" with a "landing on completion" value equal to the specified "landing on arrival" value.

9. Perform "update flight path for threat zone monitoring" to an empty path (no monitoring needed).

10. At the beginning and end of the execution: perform the "set mission instructions (atomic)" command with a "full power flight authorized" value of 'no'.

1. If "straight line to the point" is specified and also "landing on arrival" is specified
Then:
a. "Full operational path to the point" is an "operational air path from current vector" (utility function) to the specified "point", with a "straight line" value of 'no'.
b. "Base control circle" is a circle centered at the specified "point" with a radius of "base control radius (CTR)" (utility function).
c. "Approach start point" is the last intersection point (hint: the first on the reverse path) of the "full operational path to the point" with the "base control circle"
d. If "approach start point" is empty (meaning the formation is inside the circle) - the "actual path" is the "full operational path to the point", otherwise - find the "actual path" as follows:
- "Arrival path to the start of the approach" is an "operational air path from current vector" (utility function) to the "approach start point", with a "straight line" value of 'yes'.
- "Approach to landing path" is the final part of the "full operational path to the point" - from the "approach start point" to its end.
- The "actual path" is a concatenation of the "arrival path to the start of the approach" and the "approach to landing path", on which (on the concatenation) a "rounding of turns for an angular path" algorithm is applied, in order to round the connection between the two paths.
Explanation: The traffic rules that apply within a "base control circle" on landing, override the "straight line to the point" instruction.

Otherwise,
The "actual path" is an "operational air path from current vector" (utility function) to the specified "point" at the typical speed, where the "straight line" value passed to the function is according to the specified "straight line to the point" value.

2. "Already there" = 'yes' if the formation's location is equal to the specified "point" and the specified "landing on arrival" value is equal to the "formation on the ground" value (utility function).

3. If "already there" = 'no':
Perform a "scheduled flight along a path" on the "actual path", with the specified "arrival time".

In the first iteration only:
2. Calculate the "cyclic flight path to be executed" based on the current direction and location of the formation relative to the actual cyclic flight path (as derived from the specified "base path" and "repeat on path mode").

If the "repeat on path mode" is "orbiting the path":
- The "actual orbit radius" is the "orbit radius", otherwise - it is the "turning radius".
- "Orbit interception path" and "opposite orbit interception path" are conditional interception paths (utility function) from the current location and current direction of the formation to the "orbit path" and "opposite orbit path" respectively.
- If "orbit interception path" is not longer than "opposite orbit interception path", the "actual orbit path" is the "orbit path", otherwise it is the "opposite orbit path".

1. Definitions:

a. An "arbitrary waiting path" is a "popsicle stick" shaped path where:
     - The radius of the arcs is the turning radius at the typical flight speed for the platform type.
     - The length of the straight segment is equal to the radius of the arcs multiplied by 'turning radius to straight leg multiplier'.
     - The "popsicle stick" is located so that the formation (at its current location and direction) is at the end of its left straight segment,
    at the point where it is supposed to start turning right on the upper arc.

b. The "actual waiting path" is the specified "waiting path" - if it is not empty, otherwise - it is the straight line that forms the center spine of the "arbitrary waiting path".

2. Save in the formation's memory the "actual end time" which is:
     - The specified "end time" - if it is not empty, otherwise
     - The current time value plus the specified "waiting duration" - if it is not empty, otherwise
     - An empty time value.

3. If a waiting path is specified and the formation is not allowed to intercept it at its starting point (utility function "formation is allowed to intercept a path directly"):
- Perform "set mission execution state" to "en route".
- Perform flight to a point to the start of the specified waiting path.

4. Perform a "cyclic flight along a path" on the "actual waiting path" with a "repeat on path" value of "orbiting the path".

Arrival time
426
If specified - the formation adjusts its flight speed within the possible limits to meet the required time.
427
Waiting on arrival
428
Whether to wait after arriving at the sector.
If no value is specified then:
- If "waiting area" is specified - waiting will be performed.
- If "entry corridor" is specified - no waiting will be performed.
- If neither is specified - waiting will be derived from the attack profile as defined in the timing instructions: in hunter - yes, in supplies - no.
429
A 'no' value for "waiting on arrival" contradicts the specification of a "waiting area".
430

If the anchor event is "direction exit" - the end of the entry corridor (the direction exit point) must be reached at the anchor time.
439
A command should not be defined as an anchor when an arrival time is specified. An anchor command is timed only according to the anchor time defined in the timing instructions.
440
1. Definitions:
- The "actual sector" is the specified sector or the sector implied by the specified "waiting area" / "entry corridor".
- The "actual waiting route" is the "waiting area" - if specified, otherwise - the "preferred route" (atomic function) for waiting in the "actual sector" (may be empty).
- The "entry path" is the entry path (utility function) to the center of the "actual sector" based on [the geometry of] the specified "actual entry corridor".
- The "actual waiting on arrival" value (yes/no) is determined as defined in the description of the "waiting on arrival" parameter.
- The "expected anchor event" is "stabilization" - if the "actual waiting on arrival" value is 'yes', otherwise - "direction exit".
- The "actual arrival time" (may be empty) is determined as follows: if "is anchor" is specified - 'yes' - it is the formation's anchor time, otherwise it is the specified "arrival time".

3. If the formation is not inside the actual sector, or if the "actual waiting on arrival" value is 'yes' and the "actual waiting route" is not empty, perform "set mission execution state" to "en route".

4. If the "actual waiting on arrival" value is 'yes' and the "actual waiting route" is not empty - perform flight to a point to the starting point of the "actual waiting route" with an "arrival time" equal to the "actual arrival time".

5. If the formation is not inside the sector and the "actual waiting on arrival" value is 'no' (entry only) or (the "actual waiting on arrival" value is 'yes' and the "actual waiting route" is empty) (entry and waiting):
- The "arrival path" is an operational air path from the current vector (utility function) to the starting point of the "entry path".
- The "shortened entry path" is the "entry path" without the part that passes inside [the polygon of] the "actual sector", except for the "excess entry range into the sector" from its beginning. Explanation: it is necessary to reach a point that is actually inside the sector and not on its perimeter.
- The "full path" is a conditional threat zone avoidance air path (utility function) based on the concatenation of the "arrival path" and the "shortened entry path".
- Perform a "scheduled flight along a path" on the "full path" with an "arrival time" equal to the "actual arrival time".

1. General definitions
- "Base path" is the reverse of the specified "path" - if "reverse path" is specified - 'yes', otherwise it is the specified "path".
- "Starting point" is the starting point of the "base path" - if "intercept path from its start" is specified - 'yes', otherwise it is the point on the "base path" closest to the current location of the formation.
- The "timing to the end of the path" value is 'yes' if the flight along a path command is scheduled to its end (utility function).
- The "expected anchor event" is "direction exit" - if "timing to the end of the path", otherwise - "stabilization".
- "Actual arrival time" (may be empty) is the formation's anchor time - if "is anchor" is specified - 'yes', otherwise it is the specified "arrival time".

2. How to calculate the "actual path"
- The "raw path" is the final segment of the "base path", starting from the "starting point".
- The "origin sector" (may be empty) is the containing sector (atomic function) of the "starting point".
- The "sector boundaries" value is determined as follows: if the "origin sector" is not empty and the entire "raw path" is inside (atomic function) the "origin sector" polygon - it is the "origin sector" polygon, otherwise - an empty polygon.
- The "raw path avoiding threat zones" is an air path avoiding threat zones (utility function) based on the "raw path" and the "sector boundaries".
- The "actual speed" is the specified "ground speed" - if specified, otherwise - the typical speed of the formation.
- The "turning radius" is the turning radius (nautical mile) (utility function) of the formation at the "actual speed".
- The "actual path" is a path with rounded turns (atomic function) based on the "raw path avoiding threat zones" and the "turning radius".

3. If "is anchor" is specified - 'yes' - perform sending of anchor alerts with "flight along a path" as "command name" and "expected anchor event" as "expected anchor event 1".

4. If a non-empty "altitude" value is specified - perform set flight characteristics (atomic) with the specified "altitude" value.

5. If the "timing to the end of the path" value is 'no' or the specified "repeat on path" value is empty - perform "set mission execution state" to "en route".

6. If the "timing to the end of the path" value is 'no' - perform flight to a point to the "starting point" with the "actual arrival time" and with the specified "ground speed" and "flight pattern" values.

7. If the specified "repeat on path" value is empty - then perform a scheduled flight along a path on the "actual path" with the "actual arrival time" as "arrival time" and with the specified "ground speed" and "flight pattern" values,
otherwise - perform a cyclic flight along a path on the "base path" with the specified "repeat on path" value and with the specified "ground speed" and "flight pattern" values.

The returned path may contain threat zone transit segments that cannot be bypassed, in particular (but not only) when the start/end point is inside a threat zone.
If the specified sector boundaries are empty - there is no restriction on the location of the bypass segments. Non-empty sector boundaries affect the choice of bypass segments as follows:
- If the suspect path is entirely within the sector boundaries - the bypass segments must also be within the sector boundaries.
- If the suspect path is not entirely within the sector boundaries - there is a preference for shortening the part of the bypass segments that passes outside the sector boundaries.

An air path intended for the specified formation, based on the specified suspect path, where segments passing through a threat zone are replaced if possible with bypass segments, only if the specified "straight line" value is 'yes' or if the formation deviates from a sector to avoid a threat zone (as derived from the flight in a threat zone approval defined in the mission instructions). The returned path has rounded turns according to the specified turning radius (in nautical miles).

Explanation: If flying in a straight line - the specified "suspect path" is a straight line on which no threat zone avoidance logic was applied at all, and therefore it must be applied here. Otherwise - the threat zone avoidance logic was already applied separately to each of the three segments of the "suspect path" (sector exit, link, sector entry), so that the "suspect path" does not violate the rules of entry and exit from sectors through entry/exit routes. In this case, another application of the threat zone avoidance logic here - without reference to sectors, may cause a violation of the rules (entry/exit not through entry/exit routes) and therefore it is conditional on the policy dictated by the mission instructions.

A flight path intended for a platform located at the specified origin point and origin direction and is supposed to fly on the specified path, while rounding turns according to the specified turning radius.
If it is specified that a takeoff should be performed and the specified path starts at the origin point - the returned path is the specified path as is (interception is not relevant), otherwise the returned path is based on a concatenation of two segments:
- The interception path to the specified path - according to "conditional interception path", or "interception path to the start" if it is specified that the path should be intercepted from its start.
- The remainder of the specified path - from the interception point to its end.

Formation is allowed to intercept a path directly
875
Whether the specified formation is allowed to intercept a path at the specified target point for interception, directly - i.e., without using an operational air path to reach the target point for interception. The answer is positive if all the following conditions are met:
- The formation is in the air.
- The formation's location is at the target point for interception (in practice up to 1 meter from it, to cover for accuracy problems) or:
    + The distance from the formation's location to the target point for interception does not exceed 5 miles and also
    + The formation's location and the target point for interception are not inside a sector or the straight line connecting them is intra-sector.
